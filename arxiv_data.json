        "summary": "  In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms\nof age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for\nreal-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote\ncontroller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming\ndata processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be\ndisplayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources\nand they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a\npromising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this\npaper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and\nconsider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC\nserver, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed\nlocally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is\nadopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message\nis generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While\nin remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the\nprevious one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and\nexponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for\nexponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing\nschemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed\nnumerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the\ncomputing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared\nto local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically\nthe conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared\nwith local computing.\n",

Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2\ntheory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts\nneeded to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible\ncomputable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\\Phi$ defined on a\nset $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \\tau_\\Phi,\n\\beta_\\Phi, \\nu_\\Phi)$, where $\\tau_\\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by\n$\\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes\nthe computable structure determined by $\\Phi$. The concept of computable\nsubmanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold\nwhich satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be\nembedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$,\nwith a computable embedding, where $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual\ntopology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.\n",

This equivalence usually holds both at a computability\nlevel and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.\nHowever, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation\nusing real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this\ncase. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers\nwere equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown\nthat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to\nComputable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a\ncomputational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the\nconnections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by\nshowing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can\nbe simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than\nthose used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about\nbounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as\nspace-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.\n",

        "summary": "  Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing\npower over classical computer \\cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum\nobject passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum\ncomputer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed\nduality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may\noffer additional computing power \\cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer\nis a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer\noffers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming\nout of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show\nthat an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum\ncomputer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.\nA $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical\ncomputer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit\nquantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical\ncomputer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing\nand quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which\na quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These\ntwo modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the\nunsorted database search problem is designed.\n",

In this paper, we provide a solution to this\nproblem.\n  We outline Marvel DC, a fully decentralized blockchain-based\ndistributed-computing protocol which formally guarantees that computers are\nstrictly incentivized to correctly perform requested computations. Furthermore,\nMarvel DC utilizes a reputation management protocol to ensure that, for any\nminority of computers not performing calculations correctly, these computers\nare identified and selected for computations with diminishing probability. We\nthen outline Privacy Marvel DC, a privacy-enhanced version of Marvel DC which\ndecouples results from the computers which computed them, making the protocol\nsuitable for computations such as Federated Learning, where results can reveal\nsensitive information about that computer that computed them. We provide an\nimplementation of Marvel DC and analyses of both protocols, demonstrating that\nthey are not only the first protocols to provide the aforementioned formal\nguarantees, but are also practical, competitive with prior attempts in the\nfield, and ready to deploy.\n",

Considering the accuracy\nrequirement of intelligent computing tasks, we formulate an optimization\nproblem of computing offloading and semantic compression. We jointly optimize\nthe system utility which are represented as computing accuracy and task delay\nrespectively to acquire the optimized system utility. To solve the proposed\noptimization problem, we decompose it into computing capacity allocation\nsubproblem and compression offloading subproblem and obtain solutions through\nconvex optimization and successive convex approximation. After that, the\noffloading decisions, computing capacity and compressed ratio are obtained in\nclosed forms. We design the computing offloading and semantic compression\nalgorithm for intelligent computing tasks in MEC systems then. Simulation\nresults represent that our algorithm converges quickly and acquires better\nperformance and resource utilization efficiency through the trend with total\nnumber of users and computing capacity compared with benchmarks.\n",

As a monad of this pair of adjoint\noperations we obtain a problem that characterizes the low functions and dually\nto this another problem that characterizes the functions that are computable\nrelative to the halting problem. Correspondingly, these two classes are the\nlargest classes of functions that can be pre or post composed to limit\ncomputable functions without leaving the class of limit computable functions.\nWe transfer these observations to the lattice of represented spaces where it\nleads to a formal Galois connection. We also formulate a version of this result\nfor computable metric spaces. Limit computability and computability relative to\nthe halting problem are notions that coincide for points and sequences, but\neven restricted to continuous functions the former class is strictly larger\nthan the latter. On computable metric spaces we can characterize the functions\nthat are computable relative to the halting problem as those functions that are\nlimit computable with a modulus of continuity that is computable relative to\nthe halting problem. As a consequence of this result we obtain, for instance,\nthat Lipschitz continuous functions that are limit computable are automatically\ncomputable relative to the halting problem. We also discuss 1-generic points as\nthe canonical points of continuity of limit computable functions, and we prove\nthat restricted to these points limit computable functions are computable\nrelative to the halting problem.

To overcome the limitations that restrict such\napplications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has\ngarnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the\nliterature owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm\nis yet to be systematically designed and reviewed. This study introduces a\nnovel concept, called aerial computing, via the amalgamation of aerial radio\naccess networks and edge computing, which attempts to bridge the gap.\nSpecifically, first, we propose a novel comprehensive computing architecture\nthat is composed of low-altitude computing, high-altitude computing, and\nsatellite computing platforms, along with conventional computing systems. We\ndetermine that aerial computing offers several desirable attributes: global\ncomputing service, better mobility, higher scalability and availability, and\nsimultaneity. Second, we comprehensively discuss key technologies that\nfacilitate aerial computing, including energy refilling, edge computing,\nnetwork softwarization, frequency spectrum, multi-access techniques, artificial\nintelligence, and big data. In addition, we discuss vertical domain\napplications (e.g., smart cities, smart vehicles, smart factories, and smart\ngrids) supported by aerial computing. Finally, we highlight several challenges\nthat need to be addressed and their possible solutions.\n",

We show that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of\nrational numbers that is nearly computably Cauchy and unbounded. Then we call a\nreal number $\\alpha$ nearly computable if there exists a computable sequence\n$(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $\\alpha$ and is nearly\ncomputably Cauchy. It is clear that every computable real number is nearly\ncomputable, and it follows from a result by Downey and LaForte (2002) that\nthere exists a nearly computable and left-computable number that is not\ncomputable. We observe that the set of nearly computable real numbers is a real\nclosed field and closed under computable real functions with open domain, but\nnot closed under arbitrary computable real functions. Among other things we\nstrengthen results by Hoyrup (2017) and by Stephan and Wu (2005) by showing\nthat any nearly computable real number that is not computable is weakly\n$1$-generic (and, therefore, hyperimmune and not Martin-L\\\"of random) and\nstrongly Kurtz random (and, therefore, not $K$-trivial), and we strengthen a\nresult by Downey and LaForte (2002) by showing that no promptly simple set can\nbe Turing reducible to a nearly computable real number.\n",

        "summary": "  A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum\nmechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and\nwhich could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a\nclassical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently\nproposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information\nprocessing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum\ncomputation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly\nentangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum\nresource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via\nselected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We\ndescribe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using\nmicrowave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of\na computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster\nstate quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that\nall of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the\nconstruction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an\nexperimental reality in the near future.\n",

To support human-centered\ncomputing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look\ntowards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward\nthis goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive\ncomputing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual\ncomputing.

First we describe semantic computing,\ncognitive computing, and perceptual computing to lay out distinctions while\nacknowledging their complementary capabilities.

The stringent\nrequirements of such application drove to the realization of Edge computing in\nwhich computation is offloaded near to users. Compute-less networking is an\nextension of edge computing that aims at reducing computation and abridging\ncommunication by adopting in-network computing and computation reuse.\nComputation reuse aims to cache the result of computations and use them to\nperform similar tasks in the future and, therefore, avoid redundant\ncalculations and optimize the use of resources. In this paper, we focus on the\ncorrectness of the final output produced by computation reuse. Since the input\nmight not be identical but similar, the reuse of previous computation raises\nquestions about the accuracy of the final results. To this end, we implement a\nproof of concept to study and gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of\ncomputation reuse. We are able to reduce task completion time by up to 80%\nwhile ensuring high correctness. We further discuss open challenges and\nhighlight future research directions.\n",

At the same time, the\nproliferation of machine learning techniques has empowered malicious actors to\nuse such techniques in order to breach the privacy of the execution process for\noffloaded computations. This can enable malicious actors to identify offloaded\ncomputations and infer their nature based on computation characteristics that\nthey may have access to even if they do not have direct access to the\ncomputation code. In this paper, we first demonstrate that even\nnon-sophisticated machine learning algorithms can accurately identify offloaded\ncomputations. We then explore the design space of anonymizing offloaded\ncomputations through the realization of a framework, called Camouflage.\nCamouflage features practical mechanisms to conceal characteristics related to\nthe execution of computations, which can be used by malicious actors to\nidentify computations and orchestrate further attacks based on identified\ncomputations. Our evaluation demonstrated that Camouflage can impede the\nability of malicious actors to identify executed computations by up to 60%,\nwhile incurring modest overheads for the anonymization of computations.\n",

        "summary": "  Age-of-information (AoI) is a novel metric that measures the freshness of\ninformation in status update scenarios. It is essential for real-time\napplications to transmit status update packets to the destination node as\ntimely as possible. However, for some applications, status information embedded\nin the packets is not revealed until complicated data processing, which is\ncomputational expensive and time consuming. As mobile edge server has\nsufficient computational resource and is placed close to users, mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) is expected to reduce age for computation-intensive messages.\nIn this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive data in MEC, and\nconsider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at\nMEC server. The two computing models are unified into a two-node tandem queuing\nmodel. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the\nprevious one leaves the first node. We consider exponentially distributed\nservice time and infinite queue size, and hence, the second node can be seen as\na First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) M/M/1 system. Closed-form average AoI is\nderived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing\noutperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the\nremote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote\ncomputing rate is large enough, and that there exists an optimal transmission\nrate so that remote computing is better than local computing for a largest\nrange.\n",

        "summary": "  Most data analytics systems that require low-latency execution and efficient\nutilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational\nparadigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental\ncomputation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything\nfrom scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate\ncomputation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact\noutput.\n  Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of\ncomputing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping\nparts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of\nintermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results\nacross jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input.\nApproximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset\nto compute over a subset of data items.\n  In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms\nare complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to:\ndesign a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized\ndata items from previous runs. To concretize this idea, we designed an online\nstratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce\nan incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented\nour algorithm in a data analytics system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark\nStreaming. Our evaluation of the system shows that IncApprox achieves the\nbenefits of both incremental and approximate computing.\n",

Neuromorphic systems are extremely\nenergy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs\nand GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as\nautonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For\nthis reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future\ncomputing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based\nmachine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning\napplications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based\nsimulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be\ncapable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of\nneuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove\nthat neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of\ngeneral-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic\ncomputing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two\nsynaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for\ncomputing all the {\\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and\nprojection functions) and all the {\\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition,\nprimitive recursion and minimization operators).

Yet, engineering long running computing systems that achieve their\ngoals in ever-changing environments pose significant challenges. Currently, we\ncan build computing systems that adjust or learn over time to match changes\nthat were anticipated. However, dealing with unanticipated changes, such as\nanomalies, novelties, new goals or constraints, requires system evolution,\nwhich remains in essence a human-driven activity. Given the growing complexity\nof computing systems and the vast amount of highly complex data to process,\nthis approach will eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status\nquo, we put forward a new paradigm for the design and operation of computing\nsystems that we coin \"lifelong computing.\" The paradigm starts from\ncomputing-learning systems that integrate computing/service modules and\nlearning modules. Computing warehouses offer such computing elements together\nwith data sheets and usage guides. When detecting anomalies, novelties, new\ngoals or constraints, a lifelong computing system activates an evolutionary\nself-learning engine that runs online experiments to determine how the\ncomputing-learning system needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby\nchanging its architecture and integrating new computing elements from computing\nwarehouses as needed. Depending on the domain at hand, some activities of\nlifelong computing systems can be supported by humans. We motivate the need for\nlifelong computing with a future fish farming scenario, outline a blueprint\narchitecture for lifelong computing systems, and highlight key research\nchallenges to realise the vision of lifelong computing.\n",

        "summary": "  Energy consumption in solving computational problems has been gaining growing\nattention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum\ncomputation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of\nvarious computational resources; however, its advantage in energy consumption\nhas been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to\nrelate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of\ncomplexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying the energy\nconsumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model\nthat has been conventionally used for studying query complexity in\ncomputational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper bound\nfor the achievable energy consumption of quantum computation. We also develop\ntechniques for proving a nonzero lower bound of energy consumption of classical\ncomputation based on the energy-conservation law and Landauer's principle. With\nthese general bounds, we rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an\nexponential energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for solving\na specific computational problem, Simon's problem. Furthermore, we clarify how\nto demonstrate this energy-consumption advantage of quantum computation in an\nexperimental setting. These results provide a fundamental framework and\ntechniques to explore the physical meaning of quantum advantage in the\nquery-complexity setting based on energy consumption, opening an alternative\nway to study the advantages of quantum computation.\n",

        "summary": "  Elasticity plays an important role in modern cloud computing systems. Elastic\ncomputing allows virtual machines (i.e., computing nodes) to be preempted when\nhigh-priority jobs arise, and also allows new virtual machines to participate\nin the computation. In 2018, Yang et al. introduced Coded Storage Elastic\nComputing (CSEC) to address the elasticity using coding technology, with lower\nstorage and computation load requirements. However, CSEC is limited to certain\ntypes of computations (e.g., linear) due to the coded data storage based on\nlinear coding. Then Centralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (CUSEC) with\nheterogeneous computation speeds was proposed, which directly copies parts of\ndata into the virtual machines. In all existing works in elastic computing, the\nstorage assignment is centralized, meaning that the number and identity of all\nvirtual machines possible used in the whole computation process are known\nduring the storage assignment. In this paper, we consider Decentralized Uncoded\nStorage Elastic Computing (DUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds, where\nany available virtual machine can join the computation which is not predicted\nand thus coordination among different virtual machines' storage assignments is\nnot allowed. Under a decentralized storage assignment originally proposed in\ncoded caching by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we propose a computing scheme with\nclosed-form optimal computation time. We also run experiments over MNIST\ndataset with Softmax regression model through the Tencent cloud platform, and\nthe experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DUSEC system approaches\nthe state-of-art best storage assignment in the CUSEC system in computation\ntime.\n",

        "summary": "  In mathematics curves are typically defined as the images of continuous real\nfunctions (parametrizations) defined on a closed interval. They can also be\ndefined as connected one-dimensional compact subsets of points. For simple\ncurves of finite lengths, parametrizations can be further required to be\ninjective or even length-normalized. All of these four approaches to curves are\nclassically equivalent. In this paper we investigate four different versions of\ncomputable curves based on these four approaches. It turns out that they are\nall different, and hence, we get four different classes of computable curves.\nMore interestingly, these four classes are even point-separable in the sense\nthat the sets of points covered by computable curves of different versions are\nalso different. However, if we consider only computable curves of computable\nlengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This\nshows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of\ncomputable lengths. In addition, we show that the class of computable curves of\ncomputable lengths is point-separable from the other four classes of computable\ncurves.\n",

We aim to\nemulate how computations are performed on modern cores, since they typically\ninvolve updates of single registers. The computation model of memoryless\ncomputation can be fully expressed in terms of transformation semigroups, or in\nthe case of bijective functions, permutation groups. In this paper, we view\nregisters as elements of a finite field and we compute linear permutations\nwithout memory. We first determine the maximum complexity of a linear function\nwhen only linear instructions are allowed. We also determine which linear\nfunctions are hardest to compute when the field in question is the binary field\nand the number of registers is even. Secondly, we investigate some matrix\ngroups, thus showing that the special linear group is internally computable but\nnot fast. Thirdly, we determine the smallest set of instructions required to\ngenerate the special and general linear groups. These results are important for\nmemoryless computation, for they show that linear functions can be computed\nvery fast or that very few instructions are needed to compute any linear\nfunction. They thus indicate new advantages of using memoryless computation.\n",

Coded computation\ntechniques leverage coding theory to inject computational redundancy and\nmitigate stragglers in distributed computations. In this paper, we propose a\ndynamic workload distribution strategy for coded computation called Slack\nSqueeze Coded Computation ($S^2C^2$). $S^2C^2$ squeezes the compute slack\n(i.e., overhead) that is built into the coded computing frameworks by\nefficiently assigning work for all fast and slow nodes according to their\nspeeds and without needing to re-distribute data. We implement an LSTM-based\nspeed prediction algorithm to predict speeds of compute nodes. We evaluate\n$S^2C^2$ on linear algebraic algorithms, gradient descent, graph ranking, and\ngraph filtering algorithms. We demonstrate 19% to 39% reduction in total\ncomputation latency using $S^2C^2$ compared to job replication and coded\ncomputation.

        "summary": "  Quantum computing is poised to dramatically change the computational\nlandscape, worldwide. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that are, at\nleast in some cases, beyond the ability of even advanced future classical-style\ncomputers. In addition to being able to solve these classical\ncomputer-unsolvable problems, quantum computers have demonstrated a capability\nto solve some problems (such as prime factoring) much more efficiently than\nclassical computing. This will create problems for encryption techniques, which\ndepend on the difficulty of factoring for their security. Security, scientific,\nand other applications will require access to quantum computing resources to\naccess their unique capabilities, speed and economic (aggregate computing time\ncost) benefits. Many scientific applications, as well as numerous other ones,\nuse grid computing to provide benefits such as scalability and resource access.\nAs these applications may benefit from quantum capabilities - and some future\napplications may require quantum capabilities - identifying how to integrate\nquantum computing systems into grid computing environments is critical. This\npaper discusses the benefits of grid-connected quantum computers and what is\nrequired to achieve this.\n",

In this MEC system, we focus on three computing schemes:\n(i) The local computing scheme where all computational tasks are computed by\nthe local server at the UE, (ii) The edge computing scheme where all\ncomputational tasks are computed by the edge server at the BS, and (iii) The\npartial computing scheme where computational tasks are partially allocated at\nthe edge server and the rest are computed by the local server. Considering\nexponentially distributed transmission time and computation time and adopting\nthe first come first serve (FCFS) queuing policy, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for the average AoI and average PAoI. To address the complexity of\nthe average AoI expression, we derive simple upper and lower bounds on the\naverage AoI, which allow us to explicitly examine the dependence of the optimal\noffloading decision on the MEC system parameters. Aided by simulation results,\nwe verify our analysis and illustrate the impact of system parameters on the\nAoI performance.\n",

A computation environment consists of two main\nparts: i) a universal processor and ii) a computist who uses the computability\npower of the universal processor to perform effective procedures. The notion of\ncomputation finds it meaning, for the computist, through his\n\\underline{interaction} with the universal processor.\n  We are interested in those computation environments which can be considered\nas alternative for the real computation environment that the human being is its\ncomputist. These computation environments must have two properties: 1- being\nphysically plausible, and 2- being enough powerful.\n  Based on Copeland' criteria for effective procedures, we define what a\n\\emph{physically plausible} computation environment is.\n  We construct two \\emph{physically plausible} and \\emph{enough powerful}\ncomputation environments: 1- the Turing computation environment, denoted by\n$E_T$, and 2- a persistently evolutionary computation environment, denoted by\n$E_e$, which persistently evolve in the course of executing the computations.\n  We prove that the equality of complexity classes $\\mathrm{P}$ and\n$\\mathrm{NP}$ in the computation environment $E_e$ conflicts with the\n\\underline{free will} of the computist.\n  We provide an axiomatic system $\\mathcal{T}$ for Turing computability and\nprove that ignoring just one of the axiom of $\\mathcal{T}$, it would not be\npossible to derive $\\mathrm{P=NP}$ from the rest of axioms.\n  We prove that the computist who lives inside the environment $E_T$, can never\nbe confident that whether he lives in a static environment or a persistently\nevolutionary one.\n",

        "summary": "  Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in\nnon-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has\nbrought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been,\nhowever, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a\ncomputer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and\neven claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we\nintroduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a\nphysical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract\ncomputational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the\ncomparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in\nexperimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of\nthe similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,\nleading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical\nsystem to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that\nmust be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate\nthese with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also\ncovers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer\nuser. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the\nrole this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.\n",

It is based on the key concept that future computing\nresources will be coupled with communication resources, for enhancing user\nexperience of the connected users, and also for optimising resources in the\nproviders' infrastructures. Such coupling is achieved by Joint/Cooperative\nresource allocation algorithms, by integrating computing and communication\nservices and by integrating hardware in networks. Such type of computing, by\nwhich computing services are not delivered independently but dependent of\nnetworking services, is named Aqua Computing. The authors see Aqua Computing as\na novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where\ncomputing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are\nconnected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource\ncoupling is named computation dissolving. Then, an Aqua Computing architecture\nis proposed for mobile edge networks, in which computing and wireless\nnetworking resources are allocated jointly or cooperatively by a Mobile Cloud\nController, for the benefit of the end-users and/or for the benefit of the\nservice providers. Finally, a working prototype of the system is shown and the\ngathered results show the performance of the Aqua Computing prototype.\n",

        "summary": "  The acceleration race of digital computing technologies seems to be steering\ntoward impasses -- technological, economical and environmental -- a condition\nthat has spurred research efforts in alternative, \"neuromorphic\" (brain-like)\ncomputing technologies. Furthermore, since decades the idea of exploiting\nnonlinear physical phenomena \"directly\" for non-digital computing has been\nexplored under names like \"unconventional computing\", \"natural computing\",\n\"physical computing\", or \"in-materio computing\". This has been taking place in\nniches which are small compared to other sectors of computer science. In this\npaper I stake out the grounds of how a general concept of \"computing\" can be\ndeveloped which comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and possible\nfuture \"computing\" paradigms. The main contribution of this paper is a\nwide-scope survey of existing formal conceptualizations of \"computing\". The\nsurvey inspects approaches rooted in three different kinds of background\nmathematics: discrete-symbolic formalisms, probabilistic modeling, and\ndynamical-systems oriented views. It turns out that different choices of\nbackground mathematics lead to decisively different understandings of what\n\"computing\" is. Across all of this diversity, a unifying coordinate system for\ntheorizing about \"computing\" can be distilled. Within these coordinates I\nlocate anchor points for a foundational formal theory of a future\ncomputing-engineering discipline that includes, but will reach beyond, digital\nand neuromorphic computing.\n",

        "summary": "  We present macroeconomic model that describes evolution of macroeconomic\nvariables and macroeconomic waves on economic space. Risk ratings of economic\nagents play role of their coordinates on economic space. Aggregation of\neconomic variables like Assets and Investment, Credits and Loans of economic\nagents at point x define corresponding macroeconomic variables as functions of\ntime t and coordinates x on economic space. Evolution of macroeconomic\nvariables is determined by economic and financial transactions between economic\nagents. Such transactions can occur between economic agents with any\ncoordinates x and y and that reflect non-local \"action-at-a-distance\" character\nof internal macroeconomic interactions. For instance, Buy-Sell transactions\nbetween points x and y on economic space define dynamics of Assets at point x\nand Investment at point y. Aggregates of transactions between economic agents\nat point x and y on economic space define economic fields as functions of two\ncoordinates. To describe dynamics of economic fields on economic space we\nderive hydrodynamic-like equations. For simple models of interactions between\neconomic fields we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form and\nobtain wave equations for their perturbations. Economic field waves propagate\non economic space and their amplitudes can grow up as exponent in time and may\ndisturb economic stability. Diversities of macroeconomic and financial waves on\neconomic space in simple models uncover importance of wave processes for\nmacroeconomic modeling and forecasting.\n",

We use risk\nratings of economic agents as their coordinates on economic space. Aggregates\nof economic or financial variables like Investment, Assets, Demand, Credits and\netc. of economic agents near point x define corresponding macroeconomic\nvariables as functions of time t and coordinates x on economic space. Parallels\nbetween multi-agent and multi-particle systems on economic space allow describe\ntransition from economic kinetic-like to economic hydrodynamic-like\napproximation and derive macroeconomic hydrodynamic-like equations on economic\nspace. Economic or financial transactions between economic agents determine\nevolution of macroeconomic variables This paper describes local macroeconomic\napproximation that takes into account transactions between economic agents with\ncoordinates near same point x on economic space only and describes interaction\nbetween macroeconomic variables by linear differential operators. For simple\nmodel of interaction between macroeconomic variables as Demand on Investment\nand Interest Rate we derive hydrodynamic-like equations in a closed form. For\nperturbations of these macroeconomic variables we derive macroeconomic wave\nequations. Macroeconomic waves on economic space can propagate with exponential\ngrowth of amplitude and cause irregular time fluctuations of macroeconomic\nvariables or induce economic crises.\n",

The paper finds that public investment has a strong positive\nimpact on economic growth than private investment. Gross capital formation,\nlabor growth, and government final consumption expenditure were found\nsignificant in explaining the economic growth.

Furthermore,\nthis research used an empirical measurement model that made it possible to\nidentify certain phenomena such as regional poles of regional economic\ndevelopment (PRDE) that surround economically flourishing regions. In addition,\nit showed that municipalities with high degrees of economic growth were\nimpacted by digital economic activity and specialized knowledge.

        "summary": "  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused one of the most serious social\nand economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza\npandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as\nwell as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in\na region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major\nproblem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts\ncertain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such\neconomic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,\nthere is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,\nwhich is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul\nSamuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or\notherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future\ngenerations.\n",

However, the\nrelative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional\nvariables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions.\nThe novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate\nmeasures of productive inputs, and considers instead a more granular and\nstructural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e. their\ncapabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in\nexplaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ\neconomic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex\nnetwork techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more\ntraditional drivers of growth, we build a bridge between economic growth\ntheories and the economic complexity literature. Our findings, in agreement\nwith other recent empirical studies, show that fitness plays a crucial role in\nfostering economic growth and, when it is included in the analysis, can be\neither complementary to traditional drivers of growth or can completely\novershadow them.\n",

We find that the PCA-based global\neconomic policy uncertainty index is a good proxy for the economic policy\nuncertainty on a global scale, which is quite consistent with the GDP-weighted\nglobal economic policy uncertainty index. The PCA-based economic policy\nuncertainty index is found to be positively related with the volatility and\ncorrelation of the global financial market, which indicates that the stocks are\nmore volatile and correlated when the global economic policy uncertainty is\nhigher. The PCA-based global economic policy uncertainty index performs\nslightly better because the relationship between the PCA-based uncertainty and\nmarket volatility and correlation is more significant.\n",

        "summary": "  Since Reform and Opening-up 40 years ago, China has made remarkable\nachievements in economic fields. And consumption activities, including\nhousehold consumption, have played an important role in it. Consumer activity\nis the end of economic activity, because the ultimate aim of other economic\nactivities is to meet consumer demand; consumer activity is the starting point\nof economic activity, because consumption can drive economic and social\ndevelopment. This paper selects the economic data of more than 40 years since\nReform and Opening-up, and establishes the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model\nand Vector Error Correction (VEC) model, analyzing the influence of consumption\nlevel and total consumption of urban and rural residents on economic growth.\nThe conclusion is that the increase of urban consumption and rural consumption\ncan lead to the increase of GDP, and in the long run, urban consumption can\npromote economic growth more than rural consumption. According to this\nconclusion, we analyze the reasons and puts forward some policy suggestions.\n",

Since the relation between\nbasic principles of physics and economics is not established, there is no\nreason why physical theories should be of any value for economic theory. While\neconomic theories leave the physicists largely without orientation in this\nfield, econo-physicists should orient themselves at concrete problems from\neconomic practice rather than from economic academics. Thereby physicists\nshould respect the lead of economists. This then also puts physics closer to\neconometrics.

        "summary": "  Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience offer systematic evidence that\nfictional works exert a surprisingly strong influence on readers and have the\npower to shape their opinions and worldviews. Building on these findings, we\nstudy what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and\nstructure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect\neconomic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent\nof the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have\nseen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the\nimportance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic\nmodel and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency\nof the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find\nthat some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with\neconomists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain\nnumerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and\ninsights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation\nand dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals\nwho see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but\nfail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as\nallocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.\n",

Our computational economic analysis corroborates\nthat the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a\nsignificant role as source of inequality, while institutional arrangements\nincluding taxation play a significant role in framing and shaping the aggregate\neconomic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time.\n",

Although some empirical evidence\nsupports this logic, it has also been the subject of recent criticisms.\nSpecifically, entrepreneurship does not lead to growth in developing countries;\nit only does in more developed countries with higher income levels. Using\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Monitor data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to\n2014, we examine the contribution of entrepreneurship towards economic growth.\nOur evidence validates earlier studies findings but also exposes previously\nundiscovered findings. That is, we find that entrepreneurship encourages\neconomic growth but not in developing countries. In addition, our evidence\nfinds that the institutional environment of the country, as measured by GEM\nEntrepreneurial Framework Conditions, only contributes to economic growth in\nmore developed countries but not in developing countries. These findings have\nimportant policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy\nproposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market\ninstitutions that support it to encourage economic growth in developing\ncountries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals will be unlikely to\ngenerate the economic growth desired.\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to measure the economic uncertainties by using the Hidden Markov Model\n(HMM). We construct a dimensionless index, Economic Condition Uncertainty (ECU)\nindex, which ranges from zero to one and is comparable among sectors, regions\nand periods. We used the daily electricity consumption data of more than 18,000\nfirms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show\nthat all ECU indexes, whether at sectoral or regional level, successfully\ncaptured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions.\nBesides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different\ndistricts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes\nin the uncertainty of economic conditions are mainly related to regional\neconomic structures and targeted regulatory policies faced by sectors. The ECU\nindex can also be readily extended to measure the uncertainty of economic\nconditions in various realms, which has great potentials in the future.\n",

The pivotal result is\nan operational definition for an economic force, i.e. a want or a desire, in\nterms of a price adjustment. With this, we model the price effects of scarcity\nand trade friction in analogy with the models for the spring and damping force.\nIn turn, we define economic benefits and surplus as analogous to the\ndefinitions of mechanical work and energy. These are then used to interpret the\nvarious types of economic equilibrium considered by economists from a\nmechanical perspective. The effectiveness of the analogy is illustrated by\napplying it to modelling the price and inventory dynamics of various economic\nagents -- including consumers, dealers, holders, spot and futures traders --\nusing linear-time invariant systems theory.\n",

Inspired by the Keller-Segel model, traditionally applied in biological\ncontexts, my model adapts this framework to analyze urban and economic\ndynamics. The simulation employs two coupled partial differential equations to\nrepresent the evolution of population density and money concentration in a\nhypothetical region. Population density is initially uniform, while money\nconcentration begins with a random distribution. The model integrates diffusion\nprocesses for both population and money, coupled with a chemotactic response of\nthe population towards areas of higher economic activity. Over the course of\nthe simulation, we observe the emergence of distinct spatial patterns:\npopulation clusters forming around economic hubs and the development of wealth\nconcentration in certain areas. These patterns highlight the mutual\nreinforcement between population density and economic factors. The study\nprovides insights into the dynamics of urban growth, economic disparities, and\nresource distribution, offering a simplified yet powerful lens through which to\nview complex socio-economic systems. My findings have implications for urban\nplanning and policy-making, especially in understanding the long-term evolution\nof cities and economic centers.\n",

Through a comparative analysis\nin Oaxaca, Mexico; La Plata, Argentina; and Araucania, Chile, this research\nsheds light on the vital role that grassroots innovation plays in broader\neconomic ecosystems. Using Complex Network Analysis and the TE-SER model, the\nstudy unveils how these actors interact, collaborate, and influence major\neconomic ecosystems in the context of complex social challenges. The findings\nhighlight that actors from the grassroots innovation ecosystem make up a\nsignificant portion of the larger innovation-driven entrepreneurial economic\necosystem, accounting for between 20% and 30% in all three cases and are\nstrategically positioned within the ecosystem's structural network.\nAdditionally, this study emphasizes the potential for greater integration of\ngrassroots innovation actors to leverage resources and foster socio-economic\ndevelopment. The research concludes by advocating for further studies in\nsimilar socio-economic contexts to enhance our understanding of integration\ndynamics and mutual benefits between grassroots innovation ecosystems and other\nlarger economic systems.\n",

These agents interact\nto define production, consumption, and monetary flow. Each agent type has\ndistinct objectives, such as households seeking utility from consumption and\nthe central bank targeting inflation and production. We define this multi-agent\neconomic system using an OpenAI Gym-style environment, enabling agents to\noptimize their objectives through reinforcement learning. Standard multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) schemes, like independent learning, enable agents\nto learn concurrently but do not address whether the resulting strategies are\nat equilibrium. This study integrates the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO)\nalgorithm, which has shown superior performance over independent MARL in games\nwith homogeneous agents, with economic agent-based modeling. We use PSRO to\ndevelop agent policies approximating Nash equilibria of the empirical economic\ngame, thereby linking to economic equilibria. Our results demonstrate that PSRO\nstrategies achieve lower regret values than independent MARL strategies in our\neconomic system with four agent types. This work aims to bridge artificial\nintelligence, economics, and empirical game theory towards future research.\n",

In particular, the economic content of such speeches\naffects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason,\nwe examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches\nstated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump\n(February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means\nof text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of\nsignificant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic\ncontent of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by\ntalks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the\noccurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network\ndisplays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central\nand densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and\nsparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries\nemployed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The\nPresidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic\n(non-technical) economic locutions like \"interest\" or \"trade\". While the use of\nmore technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g.\n\"yield\" ). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic\ndictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during\nthe US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic\ncontent relationships among Presidents' speeches.\n",

We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x\non economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their\nrisk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by\nscales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare\nwith economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from\nkinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.\nAggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro\nvariables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and\nfinancial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.\nAggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y\ndetermine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of\nmacro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions\nbetween macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.\nWe show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of\neconomic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit\ntransactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to\nBorrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe\nrepayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use\nhydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of\nordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of\nmacro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The\nnature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of \"mean\nrisk\" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.\n",

Even though empirical approaches that try\nto quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no\ntheory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives\nunderlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic\nliterature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that\nare at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active\ndrivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative\neconomics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating\nfive important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be\neconomically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social\ncontext and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a\ncollective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of\nnarratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to\nthe popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the\ncomplementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language\nprocessing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go\nbeyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative\neconomics.\n",

        "summary": "  Many experimental studies report that economics students tend to act more\nselfishly than students of other disciplines, a finding that received\nwidespread public and professional attention. Two main explanations that the\nexisting literature offers for the differences found in the behavior between\neconomists and noneconomists are the selection effect, and the indoctrination\neffect. We offer an alternative, novel explanation. We argue that these\ndifferences can be explained by differences in the interpretation of the\ncontext. We test this hypothesis by conducting two social dilemma experiments\nin the US and Israel with participants from both economics and non-economics\nmajors. In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit\nmaximization, that is the market norm and workers welfare, that is the social\nnorm. We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants receive\nbefore they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues\nsignaling that the decision has an economic context, both economics and\nnon-economics students tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive\ncues emphasizing social norms, on the other hand, both economics and\nnon-economics students are less likely to maximize profits. We conclude that\nsome of the differences found between the decisions of economics and\nnon-economics students can be explained by contextual cues.\n",

As a result, appearance of economic crisis is determined by two\npoints; that is, (a). Stock market approaches perfect competition; (b). Society\nreaches full employment. The empirical research of these two points would lead\nto early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state\nof economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the\nArrow-Debreu model. That means that we can not understand the origin of\neconomic crisis within the framework of modern economics, for example, the\ngeneral equilibrium theory.\n",

As opposed to the standard view that economic growth and income\ninequality are positively related, the findings of this paper suggest that\nother factors such as education and healthcare spending are also driving\nfactors of income inequality in Turkey. The proven positive impact of\ninvestment in education and health care on income equality could aid\npolicymakers who aim to achieve fairer income equality and economic growth, in\ninvestment decisions.\n",

        "summary": "  Conventional economic analysis of stringent climate change mitigation policy\ngenerally concludes various levels of economic slowdown as a result of\nsubstantial spending on low carbon technology. Equilibrium economics however\ncould not explain or predict the current economic crisis, which is of financial\nnature. Meanwhile the economic impacts of climate policy find their source\nthrough investments for the diffusion of environmental innovations, in parts a\nfinancial problem. Here, we expose how results of economic analysis of climate\nchange mitigation policy depend entirely on assumptions and theory concerning\nthe finance of the diffusion of innovations, and that in many cases, results\nare simply re-iterations of model assumptions. We show that, while equilibrium\neconomics always predict economic slowdown, methods using non-equilibrium\napproaches suggest the opposite could occur. We show that the solution to\nunderstanding the economic impacts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions lies\nwith research on the dynamics of the financial sector interacting with\ninnovation and technology developments, economic history providing powerful\ninsights through important analogies with previous historical waves of\ninnovation.\n",

By elucidating the relationship\nbetween FDI and domestic investment, the study contributes valuable insights\nfor economic policy formulation and future investments. The findings hold\nsignificance in shaping Chile's international perception as an investment\ndestination, potentially influencing its standing in the global economic\nlandscape. Demonstrating that FDI is a significant driver of economic growth\ncould enhance confidence among foreign investors. The project's importance lies\nin contributing to economic knowledge and guiding strategic decisions for\nsustainable economic growth in Chile. Understanding the interplay of FDI and\ndomestic investment allows for a balanced approach, promoting stable economic\ndevelopment and mitigating issues like excessive reliance on foreign\ninvestment. The study highlights the theory of internationalization as a\nconceptual framework for understanding the motives and strategies of\nmultinational companies investing abroad. Leveraging data from sources like the\nCentral Bank of Chile, the research analyzes variables such as Chile's economic\ngrowth (GDP), FDI, and domestic investment. The hypothesis posits a significant\nlong-term causal relationship between FDI, National Investment (NI), and\nChile's Economic Growth (GDP). Statistical analysis using the Eviews 6 software\ntool confirms that attracting foreign investments and promoting internal\ninvestment are imperative for sustainable economic growth in Chile.\n",

        "summary": "  An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure\nof thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate\nproperties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money,\nprices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic\nfoundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents.\nThe approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid\nfoundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence\nof market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry\nand negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le\nChatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong\nrationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach\ngenerates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two\nor more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic\nentropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these\nare related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market\nprices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and\ngives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts,\nsuch as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in\nstandard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and\nimplications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility\nof money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in\nmacroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy\n(governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may\nprove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the\nnatural sciences.\n",

        "summary": "  China has experienced an outstanding economic expansion during the past\ndecades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of\nChina's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill\nthis gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through\nanalyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic\ncomplexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'\nECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic\ndevelopment and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of\nECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare\ndifferent measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with\nmonetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the\nnon-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have\nstronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate\nregressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other\nsocioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better\nunderstanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary\nmacroeconomic indicators.\n",

Current models consider agents' variables that are\ndetermined by the sums of values and volumes of agents' trades during some time\ninterval {\\Delta}. We call them first-order economic variables. We describe how\nthe volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes determine\nprice volatility. We argue that such a link requests consideration of agents'\neconomic variables of the second order that are composed of sums of squares of\nagents' transactions during {\\Delta}. Almost any variable of the first order\nshould be complemented by its second-order pair. Respectively, the sums of\nagents' second-order variables introduce macroeconomic variables of the second\norder. The description of the first- and second-order macroeconomic variables\nestablishes the subject of second-order economic theory. We highlight that the\ncomplexity of second-order economic theory essentially restricts any hopes for\nprecise predictions of price probability and, at best, could provide estimates\nof price volatility.

        "title": "The Use of Quantile Methods in Economic History",
        "summary": "  Quantile regression and quantile treatment effect methods are powerful\neconometric tools for considering economic impacts of events or variables of\ninterest beyond the mean. The use of quantile methods allows for an examination\nof impacts of some independent variable over the entire distribution of\ncontinuous dependent variables. Measurement in many quantative settings in\neconomic history have as a key input continuous outcome variables of interest.\nAmong many other cases, human height and demographics, economic growth,\nearnings and wages, and crop production are generally recorded as continuous\nmeasures, and are collected and studied by economic historians. In this paper\nwe describe and discuss the broad utility of quantile regression for use in\nresearch in economic history, review recent quantitive literature in the field,\nand provide an illustrative example of the use of these methods based on 20,000\nrecords of human height measured across 50-plus years in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies. We suggest that there is considerably more room in the literature on\neconomic history to convincingly and productively apply quantile regression\nmethods.\n",

Due to the critical\nrelevance of these effects for the well-being of future generations, there is\nan explosion of publications devoted to measuring this relationship and its\nmain channels. The relation between economic activity and climate change is\ncomplex with the possibility of causality running in both directions. Starting\nfrom economic activity, the channels that relate economic activity and climate\nchange are energy consumption and the consequent pollution. Hence, we first\ndescribe the main econometric contributions about the interactions between\neconomic activity and energy consumption, moving then to describing the\ncontributions on the interactions between economic activity and pollution.\nFinally, we look at the main results on the relationship between climate change\nand economic activity. An important consequence of climate change is the\nincreasing occurrence of extreme weather phenomena. Therefore, we also survey\ncontributions on the economic effects of catastrophic climate phenomena.\n",

It sought to understand\nthe effects of economic challenges on women's dietary choices and access to\nnutritious food across different socioeconomic groups. Using a mixed-methods\napproach, the research combined quantitative data from health and economic\nrecords with qualitative insights from interviews with diverse women. The study\nanalyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the\npandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic\ndifficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the\neconomic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in\nlow-income and marginalized groups. These women reported decreased access to\nhealthy foods and an increased dependence on less nutritious options due to\nbudget constraints, leading to a decline in dietary quality. This trend was\nless evident in higher-income groups, highlighting stark disparities. The\npandemic intensified pre-existing nutritional inequalities, with the most\nvulnerable groups facing greater adverse effects. However, community support\nand public health measures provided some relief. In summary, the pandemic's\neconomic repercussions have indirectly impaired women's nutritional health,\nespecially among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This highlights the\nnecessity for tailored nutritional interventions and economic policies focused\non safeguarding women's health.\n",

        "summary": "  When analyzing the components influencing the stock prices, it is commonly\nbelieved that economic activities play an important role. More specifically,\nasset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a\npervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be\nrewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In\nthe paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an\nattribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces\ninfluencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors\nfrom previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation,\nChange in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in\nnew factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they\nexamined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The\npaper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic\nnews, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the\nsignificant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by\nsuch motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general\nframework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic\nfactors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.\n",

The\narticle addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of\neconomics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science.\nMathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many\nideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These\nsame ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by\nSoviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the\neconomic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by\nexploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and\nprobability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual\nexchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling\napparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment\nabsent under the Soviet rule.\n",

As humans,\nwe exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring,\nframing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as\nsuch biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs)\nare trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases?\nUnderstanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support\nhuman decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of\nmodern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs.\nUtility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior\nagainst benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To\ndemonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a\nvariety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of\ncurrent LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We\nalso find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic\nbehavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure\nthe effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.\n",

        "summary": "  Economic inequality is one of the pivotal issues for most of economic and\nsocial policy makers across the world to insure the sustainable economic growth\nand justice. In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical\ntheories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a\nmainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic\nsystem based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital\nrole. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of\neconomic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable\nfactors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of\neconomic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in\nthe past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those\nnovel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has\nshown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school,\nunder this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner\nwhere the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and\nadaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways\nagents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs,\nAgent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians\nand practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and\nlocal interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex\npatterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an\neconomic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an\nIslamic charity rule can majorly help alleviating the inequality and how\nresource allocation strategies taken by charity entities can accelerate this\nalleviation.\n",

        "summary": "  It is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators -- functions that\nsummarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data -- in economic models since the\nearly XX$^{th}$ century. In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of\nCobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to\neconomic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this\npaper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We\nuse a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by\nBregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of\nmathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an\naggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the\nstandpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.\n  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong\nto the \\textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,\nthis large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \\textit{exactly fitting}\neither CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic\ncontexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the\ninformation standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal\ninformation aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links\nbetween economic and information aggregators.\n  Keywords: Economic Aggregators, CES, Cobb-Douglas, Bregman divergences\n",

China is\nespecially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its\nkind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates\neconomic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.\nFar from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure\ninvestment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's\ntrack record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich\ndemocracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive\nprojects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in\nfinancial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We\nconclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation\nof surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless\nChina shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the\ncountry is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic\ncrisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.\nChina's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other\ncountries but one to avoid.\n",

        "summary": "  While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice\nanalysis showing high predictive power, it is unclear to what extent\nresearchers can interpret economic information from DNNs. This paper\ndemonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as\nclassical discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information includes\nchoice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns\nof alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities,\nmarginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT).\nUnlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal\nbehavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the\neconomic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three\nchallenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to\nhyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To\ndemonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a\nstated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from\nthe DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the\neconomic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more\nreliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or\ntrainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly\nimprove the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs.\nFuture studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures,\nbetter optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address\nDNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from\nDNN-based choice models.\n",

        "summary": "  AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet\nwidely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at\nlarge. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of\ncounterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to\nexperiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that\nmachine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism\ndesign framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a\ntwo-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who\nco-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel\ntwo-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn\nrational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal\ntaxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal\ntax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist\nsubstantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off\nbetween equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent\ntax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral\nchange more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the\nfirst time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a\ncomplement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational\nlearning-based approach to understanding economic policy.\n",

        "summary": "  The study and measurement of economic resilience is ruled by high level of\ncomplexity related to the diverse structure, functionality, spatiality, and\ndynamics describing economic systems. Towards serving the demand of\nintegration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing\nengineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that\nare considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is\ncomputed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020,\nconcerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a\nconceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows\nintroducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic\nresilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of\nthis attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively\nrelated to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and\ndepended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in\nthe low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the\nworldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and\ncentrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between\ndiachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical\ndistance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by\nthe specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in\necological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and\nOceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on\nthe globe and supports a further research hypothesis that political instability\nis a main determinant of low economic resilience, addressing avenues of further\nresearch.\n",

        "summary": "  Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not\nyet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the\nmetaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures,\nand systems related to economic systems. When investigating those\nstate-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in our mind: (1) what is the\nframework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse, and (2) what\nactivities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to\ndisclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and\nthe future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic-system\nframework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements\nin the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital\ntrading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed\neconomic-system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary\nsystems, digital wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, and\ncross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly\ndiscuss three questions: a) the rationale of this topic, b) why the metaverse\nneeds this topic, and c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through\nthis overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the\nmetaverse needs, and the insights behind the economic activities in the\nmetaverse.\n",

        "summary": "  The processes of ecological interactions, dispersal and mutations shape the\ndynamics of biological communities, and analogous eco-evolutionary processes\nacting upon economic entities have been proposed to explain economic change.\nThis hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through\nendogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global\neconomy level. Here, we use an inverse modelling technique and 59 years of\neconomic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of\nnational economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary\nprocesses. We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in\nwhich the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and\nnegative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the\nactivities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find\nstrong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic\nactivities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These\nresults suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a\nsignificant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence\nobtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by\ndifferences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,\nand historical contingencies. Overall, our study provides a new quantitative,\nbiologically inspired framework to study the forces shaping economic change.\n",

        "summary": "  Energy supply is mandatory for the production of economic value.\nNevertheless, tradition dictates that an enigmatic 'invisible hand' governs\neconomic valuation. Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but\ntestable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross\ncorrelation between energy consumption and economic output at the national\nlevel through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of\nprecise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive\nevidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual\ncommodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has\naccumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides\nus the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value\ncorrelation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical\nelements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining\nthem from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear\ncorrelation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying\nphysics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such\nas the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic\nvaluation. It demonstrates how energy cost serves as the 'invisible hand'\ngoverning economic valuation. Thorough understanding of this energy connection\nbetween the human economic and the Earth's biogeochemical metabolism is\nessential for improving the overall energy efficiency and furthermore the\nsustainability of the human society.\n",

We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic\ngrowth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection\nand optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good\neconomic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted\nregressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and\ninsurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data\ncollected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the\nnighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in\npartnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFrom the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the\ninsurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development\nin South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP\nand GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic\ngrowth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary\ndata needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide\nresearchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what\npolicies to put in place. It would be interesting to extend the current study\nto other sectors such as micro-finances, mutual and hedge funds.\n",

        "summary": "  Economic evaluation is a dynamically advancing knowledge area of health\neconomics. It has been conceived to provide evidence for allocating scarce\nresources to gain the best value for money. The problem of efficiency of\ninvestments becomes even more crucial with advances in modern medicine and\npublic health which bring about both improved patient outcomes and higher\ncosts. Despite the abundance of literature on the economic evaluation concepts,\nsome key notions including the definition of the health economic evaluation\nremain open for discussion. Academic literature offers a large number and\ngrowing variety of economic evaluation definitions. It testifies to the fact\nthat existing definitions do not meet requirements of economists. The aim of\nthis study was to examine existing definitions and reveal their common\nfeatures.\n",

        "summary": "  Regulation is commonly viewed as a hindrance to entrepreneurship, but\nheterogeneity in the effects of regulation is rarely explored. We focus on\nregional variation in the effects of national-level regulations by developing a\ntheory of hierarchical institutional interdependence. Using the political\nscience theory of market-preserving federalism, we argue that regional economic\nfreedom attenuates the negative influence of national regulation on net job\ncreation. Using U.S. data, we find that regulation destroys jobs on net, but\nregional economic freedom moderates this effect. In regions with average\neconomic freedom, a one percent increase in regulation results in 14 fewer jobs\ncreated on net. However, a standard deviation increase in economic freedom\nattenuates this relationship by four fewer jobs. Interestingly, this moderation\naccrues strictly to older firms; regulation usually harms young firm job\ncreation, and economic freedom does not attenuate this relationship.\n",

In this paper, we present a model\napplying the equilibrium statistical model in economic systems.

This paper presents related concepts in the\nequilibrium economic model and constructs significant theorems and corollaries,\nwhich is derived from the priori possibility postulate, getting theorems\nincluding the equilibrium theorem between open systems, the distribution\ntheorem of wealth and population along with related corollaries. More\nimportantly, we demonstrate a method constructing optimal density of states,\noptimizing a macroscopic parameter depending on need to get the distribution of\ndensity of states utilizing the variation method, which is significant for the\ndevelopment of a society. In addition, we calculate a simple economic system as\nan example, indicating that the system occupied mostly by the middle class\ncould develop stably and soundly, explaining the reason for resulting\ndistributions of macroscopic parameters.\n",

In this work,\nwe first consider a brief review of DL, RL, and deep RL methods in diverse\napplications in economics providing an in-depth insight into the state of the\nart. Furthermore, the architecture of DRL applied to economic applications is\ninvestigated in order to highlight the complexity, robustness, accuracy,\nperformance, computational tasks, risk constraints, and profitability. The\nsurvey results indicate that DRL can provide better performance and higher\naccuracy as compared to the traditional algorithms while facing real economic\nproblems at the presence of risk parameters and the ever-increasing\nuncertainties.\n",

The\namount of carbon emission caused by production activities is closely related to\nthe socio-economic environment. Therefore, from the perspective of economic\npolicy uncertainty, this article constructs the GARCH-MIDAS-EUEPU and\nGARCH-MIDAS-GEPU models for investigating the impact of European and global\neconomic policy uncertainty on carbon price fluctuations. The results show that\nboth European and global economic policy uncertainty will exacerbate the\nlong-term volatility of European carbon spot return, with the latter having a\nstronger impact when the change is the same. Moreover, the volatility of the\nEuropean carbon spot return can be forecasted better by the predictor, global\neconomic policy uncertainty. This research can provide some implications for\nmarket managers in grasping carbon market trends and helping participants\ncontrol the risk of fluctuations in carbon allowances.\n",

In\nthis context, I performed two institutional clusters depending on their\ninclusive or extractive institutional features and, in each cases, I computed\nthe crisis effect on unemployment rate over the 2003-2017 period. Both models\nwere estimated by using Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares method, and\nare weighted by Period SUR option in order to remove, in advance the possible\ninconveniences of the models. The institutions proved to be a relevant\ncriterion that drives the impact of economic and financial crises on the\nunemployment rate, highlighting that countries with inclusive institutions are\nless vulnerable to economic shocks and are more resilient than countries with\nextractive institutions. The quality of institutions was also found to have a\nsignificant effect on the response of unemployment rate to the dynamic of its\ndrivers.\n",

        "summary": "  To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have\n`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such\nlockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study\nexamines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact\nthrough supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an\nagent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in\nJapan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the\ninteractions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by\ndecomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We\nfind that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier\nsubstitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the\neconomic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region\nlifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on\nwhether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked\nthrough supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy\ncoordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.\n",

We analyzed the\nhistorical evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade\nWeb (WTW) with respect to patterns of urbanization from 1995-2010. Using the\nevolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country's economic\ndevelopment in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with\nthe urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development\nand growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between\neconomic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages,\nbecoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources\nwhere urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.\n",

In this paper, we\nstudy the social-economical development trajectories of urban cities. We\nobserve that social-economical movement of cities also exhibit the Levy flight\ncharacteristics. We collect the social and economical data such as the\npopulation, the number of students, GDP and personal income, etc. from several\ncities. Then we map these urban data into the social and economical factors\nthrough a deep-learning embedding method Auto-Encoder. We find that the\nsocial-economical factors of these cities can be fitted approximately as a\nmovement pattern of a power-law distribution. We use the Stochastic\nMultiplicative Processes (SMP) to explain such movement, where in the presence\nof a boundary constraint, the SMP leads to a power law distribution. It means\nthat the social-economical trajectories of cities also follow a Levy flight\npattern, where some years have large changes in terms of social-economical\ndevelopment, and many years have little changes.\n",

        "summary": "  The Economy Watcher Survey, which is a market survey published by the\nJapanese government, contains \\emph{assessments of current and future economic\nconditions} by people from various fields. Although this survey provides\ninsights regarding economic policy for policymakers, a clear definition of the\nword \"future\" in future economic conditions is not provided. Hence, the\nassessments respondents provide in the survey are simply based on their\ninterpretations of the meaning of \"future.\" This motivated us to reveal the\ndifferent interpretations of the future in their judgments of future economic\nconditions by applying weakly supervised learning and text mining. In our\nresearch, we separate the assessments of future economic conditions into\neconomic conditions of the near and distant future using learning from positive\nand unlabeled data (PU learning). Because the dataset includes data from\nseveral periods, we devised new architecture to enable neural networks to\nconduct PU learning based on the idea of multi-task learning to efficiently\nlearn a classifier. Our empirical analysis confirmed that the proposed method\ncould separate the future economic conditions, and we interpreted the\nclassification results to obtain intuitions for policymaking.\n",

We conducted an online experiment with British\nparticipants (N=961) when the UK introduced its first lockdown and the outbreak\nwas on its growing stage. Participants were primed with either the\nenvironmental or economic consequences (i.e., negative primes), or the\nenvironmental or economic benefits (i.e., positive primes) of the pandemic, or\nwith neutral information. We measured priming effects on an incentivized\ntake-and-give dictator game and on participants' expectations about future\nenvironmental quality and economic growth. Our results show that primes affect\nparticipants' expectations, but not their prosociality. In particular,\nparticipants primed with environmental consequences hold a more pessimistic\nview on future environmental quality, while those primed with economic benefits\nare more optimistic about future economic growth. Instead, the positive\nenvironmental prime and the negative economic prime do not influence\nexpectations. Our results offer insights into how information affects behavior\nand expectations during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",

However, since botanical pandemics are here to stay in the\nshort-medium term, domesticated field owners can strategically seed their\nfields to optimize each session's economic profit. In this work, we propose a\nnovel epidemiological-economic mathematical model that describes the economic\nprofit from a field of plants during a botanical pandemic. We describe the\nepidemiological dynamics using a spatio-temporal extended\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model with a non-linear output\neconomic model. We provide an algorithm to obtain an optimal grid-formed\nseeding strategy to maximize economic profit, given field and pathogen\nproperties. We show that the recovery and basic infection rates have a similar\neconomic influence. Unintuitively, we show that a larger farm does not promise\nhigher economic profit. Our results demonstrate a significant benefit of using\nthe proposed seeding strategy and shed more light on the dynamics of the\nbotanical pandemic.\n",

Analysing the entire firm-level production network of a\nEuropean economy, we have explored how the worst outcomes of such approaches\ncan be avoided. We compared the systemic relevance of every firm in Hungary\nwith its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies\nwith a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific\nreduction targets, we studied various decarbonization scenarios and quantified\ntheir economic consequences. We determined that for an emissions reduction of\n20%, the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of\neconomic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting the largest emitters\nfirst results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target.\nThis demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to\ndesign highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve\nemployment and economic output.\n",

The\ninteraction between agents defines the production and consumption of goods in\nthe economy alongside the flow of money. Each agent can be designed to act\naccording to fixed, rule-based strategies or learn their strategies using\ninteractions with others in the simulator. We ground our simulator by choosing\nagent heterogeneity parameters based on economic literature, while designing\ntheir action spaces in accordance with real data in the United States. Our\nsimulator facilitates the use of reinforcement learning strategies for the\nagents via an OpenAI Gym style environment definition for the economic system.\nWe demonstrate the utility of our simulator by simulating and analyzing two\nhypothetical (yet interesting) economic scenarios. The first scenario\ninvestigates the impact of heterogeneous household skills on their learned\npreferences to work at different firms. The second scenario examines the impact\nof a positive production shock to one of two firms on its pricing strategy in\ncomparison to the second firm. We aspire that our platform sets a stage for\nsubsequent research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and\neconomics.\n",

Using\nsection-level trade data from nearly 200 countries from 2010 to 2022, we\nidentify significant shifts in the network topology driven by rising trade\npolicy uncertainty. Our analysis highlights key global players through\ncentrality rankings, with the United States, China, and Germany maintaining\nconsistent dominance. Using a horse race of supervised regressors, we find that\nnetwork topology descriptors evaluated from section-specific trade networks\nsubstantially enhance the quality of a country's GDP growth forecast. We also\nfind that non-linear models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM,\noutperform traditional linear models used in the economics literature. Using\nSHAP values to interpret these non-linear model's predictions, we find that\nabout half of most important features originate from the network descriptors,\nunderscoring their vital role in refining forecasts. Moreover, this study\nemphasizes the significance of recent economic performance, population growth,\nand the primary sector's influence in shaping economic growth predictions,\noffering novel insights into the intricacies of economic growth forecasting.\n",

The economics of land management in Russia\nwhich is shaped by both historical legacies and contemporary policies\nrepresents an interesting conundrum. Following the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion, Russia embarked on a thorny and complex path towards the economic\nreforms and transformation characterized, among all, by the privatization and\ndecentralization of land ownership. This transition was aimed at improving\nagricultural productivity and fostering sustainable regional economic\ndevelopment but also led to new challenges such as uneven distribution of land\nresources, unclear property rights, and underinvestment in rural\ninfrastructure. However, managing all of that effectively poses significant\nchallenges and opportunities.

The curriculum of this\ndepartment conforms to typical computer science curricula of US engineering\nschools with a noticeable omission of comparable electrical engineering\ncourses. When developing the course, I did my best to pay attention to learning\npreferences of the department's student body. I also hoped to contribute to a\ndegree to meeting labor market demands for developers of electrical engineering\nCAD software.

The AB-Space Engine gets the energy from\nground-mounted power; a planet electric station can transfer electricity up to\n1000 millions (and more) of kilometers by plasma wires. Author shows that\nAB-Space Engine can produce thrust of 10 tons (and more). That can accelerate a\nspace ship to some thousands of kilometers/second. AB-Space Engine has a\nstaggering specific impulse owing to the very small mass expended. The AB-Space\nEngine reacts not by expulsion of its own mass (unlike rocket engine) but\nagainst the mass of its planet of origin (located perhaps a thousand of\nmillions of kilometers away) through the magnetic field of its plasma cable.\nFor creating this plasma cable the AB-Space Engine spends only some kg of\nhydrogen.\n",

The formalism goes beyond the known optimal\nefficiency and power for systems with or without time-reversal symmetry,\nshowing interesting features that have not been revealed before. A concrete\nexample of quantum-dot heat engine is studied to show that the current set-up\ncan have much improved efficiency and power compared with previous set-ups with\nonly one output electric current. Our analytical results also apply for\nthermoelectric heat engines with multiple output electric currents, providing\nan alternative scheme toward future high-performance thermoelectric materials.\n",

A simple,\nanalytical procedure is used to determine the embodied energy and emissions.\nThe objective is to assess the potential of electric cars to reduce green house\ngases emission to limit global warming to < 1.5 degrees C by the Year 2050 as\nper IPCC recommendations and also to compare them with conventional fuel driven\ncars. The combined embodied energy for Nd- and Dy-metals production which are\nrequired in electric motors and battery assembly for 150 million cars,\nprojected to be on the road in the year 2050 is ~ 1500 TWh and the CO2\nemissions is found to be > 600 MT. The emissions includes carbon intensity of\nelectrical energy required to run these electric vehicles. The projected\nemissions due to fossil fuels, gasoline production as well as burning it in\ncombustion engines however is only 412 MT, far less than that due to electric\nvehicles. The main contributor to emissions from electric vehicles is the\nbattery assembling process which releases ~ 379 MT of CO2-e gases. The\nemissions from both electric vehicles as well as combustion engine vehicles\nscale linearly with the number of vehicles, indicating that a breakeven is not\npossible with the currently available manufacturing technologies. These results\nclearly show that significant technological developments have to take place in\nelectric vehicles so that they become environmentally better placed compared to\ncombustion engine based cars.\n",

        "summary": "  Strain provides an effective means to tune the electrical properties while\nretaining the native chemical composition of the material. Unlike\nthree-dimensional solids, two-dimensional materials withstand higher levels of\nelastic strain making it easier to tune various electrical properties to suit\nthe technology needs. In this work we explore the effect of uniaxial\ntensile-strain on the electrical transport properties of bi- and few-layered\nMoS2, a promising 2D semiconductor. Raman shifts corresponding to the in-plane\nvibrational modes show a redshift with strain indicating a softening of the\nin-plane phonon modes. Photo luminescence measurements reveal a redshift in the\ndirect and the indirect emission peaks signalling a reduction in the material\nbandgap. Transport measurements show a substantial enhancement in the\nelectrical conductivity with a high piezoresistive gauge factor of ~ 321\nsuperior to that for Silicon for our bi-layered device. The simulations\nconducted over the experimental findings reveal a substantial reduction of the\nSchottky barrier height at the electrical contacts in addition to the\nresistance of MoS2. Our studies reveal that strain is an important and\nversatile ingredient to tune the electrical properties of 2D materials and also\ncan be used to engineer high-efficiency electrical contacts for future device\nengineering.\n",

        "summary": "  Electrokinetic (EK) flow is a type of flow driven or manipulated by electric\nbody forces, influenced by various factors such as electric field intensity,\nelectric field form, frequency, electric permittivity/conductivity, fluid\nviscosity and etc. The diversity of dimensionless control parameters, such as\nthe electric Rayleigh number, complicates the comparison of EK flow stability.\nConsequently, comparing the performance and cost of micromixers or reactors\nbased on EK flow is challenging, posing an obstacle to their industrial and\nengineering applications. In this investigation, we theoretically derived a new\nelectric Rayleigh number ($Ra_e$) that quantifies the relationship among\nelectric body forces, fluid viscosity, and ion diffusivity, based on a tanh\nmodel of electric conductivity distribution. The calculation results indicate\nthat the new $Ra_e$ exhibits richer variation with the control parameters and\nbetter consistency with previous experimental reports. We further conducted\nexperimental studies on the critical electric Rayleigh number ($Ra_{ec}$) of AC\nEK flow of binary fluids in a divergent microchannel. The experimental\nvariations align well with the theoretical predictions, particularly the\nexistence of an optimal AC frequency and electric conductivity ratio,\ndemonstrating that the tanh model can better elucidate the underlying physics\nof EK flow. With the new electric Rayleigh number, we found that EK flow in the\ndesigned divergent microchannel has a much smaller $Ra_{ec}$ than previously\nreported, indicating that EK flow is more unstable and thus more suitable for\napplications in micromixers or reactors in industry and engineering.\n",

        "summary": "  We study a quantum Otto engine operating on the basis of a helical spin- 1/2\nmultiferroic chain with strongly coupled magnetic and ferroelectric order\nparameters. The presence of a finite spin chirality in the working substance\nenables steering of the cycle by an external electric field that couples to the\nelectric polarization. We observe a direct connection between the chirality,\nthe entanglement and the efficiency of the engine. An electric-field dependent\nthreshold temperature is identified above which the pair correlations in the\nsystem, as quantified by the thermal entanglement, diminish. In contrast to the\npair correlations, the collective many-body thermal entanglement is less\nsensitive to the electric field, and in the high temperature limit converges to\na constant value. We also discuss the correlations between the threshold\ntemperature of the pair entanglement, the spin chirality and the minimum of the\nfidelities in relation to the electric and magnetic fields. The efficiency of\nthe quantum Otto cycle shows a saturation plateau with increasing electric\nfield amplitude.\n",

        "summary": "  Heat engines are considered a valuable resource for modern society. The\ndevelopment of these systems leads to the production of heat engines with high\nefficiency despite their small size, called quantum heat engines. Among these,\nthe quantum Otto cycle which is considered a fundamental thermodynamic cycle in\nclassical heat engines, has also found applications in the realm of quantum\nheat engines. In this paper, we consider three InAs quantum dots as a working\nsubstance, which allows the engine to operate at very small scales, in the\npresence of an electric field, and the Forster mechanism, which describes the\ntransfer of energy between quantum dots and affects thus the engine's behavior.\nIn this regard, we study the behavior of the work performed by the engine and\nthe entanglement in the system as the Forster parameter is varied. We find that\nthe work performed by the engine is affected by the Forster interaction and the\nelectric field and that the entanglement in the system also changed as the\nForster parameter was changed. Finally, we study the influence of entanglement\non the work performed by the engine. We find and discuss the intricate relation\nbetween the entanglement and the performance of the engine.\n",

        "summary": "  Electropolymerization is a bottom-up materials engineering process of micro\nand nano-scale that utilizes electrical signals to deposit conducting\ndendrites' morphologies by a redox reaction in the liquid phase. It resembles\nsynaptogenesis in the brain, in which electrical stimulation in the brain\ncauses the formation of synapses from the cellular neural composites. The\nstrategy has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by\nestablishing link between the electrical signals and the dendrites' shapes.\nSince the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical\nproperties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly\nunder electrically programmed conditions is an important aspect. In this\nmanuscript, we simulate this phenomenon using mesoscale simulations, taking\ninto account the important features of spatial-temporal potential mapping based\non the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid due\nto the electric field, and the attachment of particles on the electrode. The\nstudy helps in visualizing the motion of particles in different electrical\nconditions, which is not possible to probe experimentally. Consistent with the\nexperiments, the higher AC frequency of electrical activities favors linear\nwire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal\ndendrites growth, and voltage offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that\ndendrites' shape and growth process systematically depend on particle\nconcentration and random scattering. We discover that the different dendrites'\narchitectures are associated with different Laplace and diffusion fields, which\ngovern the monomers trajectory and subsequent dendrites' growth. Such\nunconventional engineering routes could have a variety of applications from\nneuromorphic engineering to bottom-up computing strategies.\n",

        "summary": "  For improving flexibility and robustness of the engineering of automated\nproduction systems (aPS) in case of extending, reducing or modifying parts,\nseveral approaches propose an encapsulation and clustering of related\nfunctions, e.g. from the electrical, mechanical or software engineering, based\non a modular architecture. Considering the development of these modules, there\nare different stages, e.g. module planning or functional engineering, which\nhave to be completed. A reference model that addresses the different stages for\nthe engineering of aPS is proposed by AutomationML. Due to these different\nstages and the integration of several engineering disciplines, e.g. mechanical,\nelectrical/electronic or software engineering, information not limited to one\ndiscipline are stored redundantly increasing the effort to transfer information\nand the risk of inconsistency. Although, data formats for the storage and\nexchange of plant engineering information exist, e.g. AutomationML, fixed\ndomain specific structures and relations of the information, e.g. for automated\nmaterial flow systems (aMFS), are missing. This paper presents the integration\nof a meta model into the development of modules for aMFS to improve the\ntransferability and consistency of information between the different\nengineering stages and the increasing level of detail from the coarse-grained\nplant planning to the fine-grained functional engineering.\n",

In\ncontrast, heat currents in mesoscopic heat engines show fluctuations. Thus,\nthere is a small probability that a mesoscopic heat engine exceeds Carnot's\nmaximum value during a short measurement time. We illustrate this effect using\na quantum point contact as a heat engine. When a temperature difference is\napplied to a quantum point contact, the system may be utilized as a source of\nelectrical power under steady state conditions. We first discuss the optimal\nworking point of such a heat engine that maximizes the generated electrical\npower and subsequently calculate the statistics for deviations of the\nefficiency from its most likely value. We find that deviations surpassing the\nCarnot limit are possible, but unlikely.\n",

We propose a minimal spin\nmodel Hamiltonian, consisting of symmetric isotropic exchange interactions,\nmagnetic anisotropy energy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, to\ncapture most pertinent magnetic properties of the system. We compute the\nmechanical strain and electric field dependence of various spin-spin\ninteractions. Our results show that both the amplitudes and signs of the\nexchange interactions can be engineered by means of strain, while the electric\nfield affects only their amplitudes. However, strain and electric fields affect\nboth the directions and amplitudes of the DM vectors. The amplitude of the\nmagnetic anisotropy energy can also be substantially modified by an applied\nstrain. We show that in comparison with an electric field, strain can be more\nefficiently used to manipulate the magnetic and electronic properties of the\nsystem. Notably, such systematic tuning of the spin interactions is essential\nfor the engineering of room-temperature spintronic nanodevices.\n",

        "summary": "  The challenge in solar energy today is not the cost of photovoltaic (PV)\nelectricity generation, already competing with fossil fuel prices, but rather\nutility-scale energy storage and flexibility in supply. Low-cost thermal energy\nstorage (TES) exists but relies on expensive heat engines. Here, we introduce\nthe concept of luminescent solar power (LSP), where sunlight is absorbed in a\nphotoluminescent (PL) absorber, followed by red-shifted PL emission matched to\nan adjacent PV cell's band-edge. This way the PV cell operates nearly as\nefficiently as under direct illumination, but with minimal excessive heat. The\nPL-absorber temperature rises due to thermalization, allowing it to store the\nexcessive heat, which can later be converted into electricity. Tailored\nluminescent materials that support an additional 1.5kWh PV-electricity for\nevery 1 kWh of (virtual) heat engine-electricity, with a dynamic shift between\nthe two sources are experimentally demonstrated. Such an ideal hybrid system\nmay lead to a potential reduction in the cost of electricity for a base-load\nsolution.\n",

However, photons do not have charge and do not directly\ninteract with electric fields. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed to\nrealize electric fields in photonics. One approach is to use engineered gauge\nfields that can mimic the effect of electric fields and produce the same\ndynamical behavior. Here, we demonstrate such an electric field for photons\npropagating in a two-dimensional synthetic space. We achieve this using a\nlinearly time-varying gauge field generated by direction-dependent phase\nmodulations. We show that the generated electric field leads to Bloch\noscillations and the revival of the state after a certain number of steps\ndependent on the field strength. We measure the probability of the revival and\ndemonstrate good agreement between the observed values and the theoretically\npredicted results. Furthermore, by applying a nonuniform electric field, we\nshow the possibility of waveguiding photons. Ultimately, our results open up\nnew opportunities for manipulating the propagation of photons with potential\napplications in photonic quantum simulations.\n",

It\nis shown that current technology allows humans to create a light propulsion (AB\nengine) which does not depend on air, water or ground terrain. Simultaniosly,\nthis revolutionary thruster is a device for the storage of electricity which is\nextracted and is replenished (during braking) from/into the storage with 100\npercent efficiency. The relative weight ratio of this engine is 0.01 - 0.1\n(from thrust). For some types of AB engine (toroidal form) the thrust easily\nmay be changed in any direction without turning of engine.\n  The author computed many projects using different versions of offered AB\nengine: small device for levitation-flight of a human (including flight from\nEarth to Outer Space), fly VTOL car (track), big VTOL aircrat, suspended low\naltitude stationary satellite, powerful Space Shuttle-like booster for travel\nto the Moon and Mars without spending energy (spended energy is replenished in\nbraking when ship returns from other planet to its point of origin), using\nAB-devices in military, in sea-going ships (submarimes), in energy industry\n(for example. as small storage of electric energy) and so on. The vehicles\nequipped with AB propulsion can take flight for days and cover distances of\ntens thousands of kilometers at hypersonic or extra-atmosphere space speeds.\n  The work contains tens of inventions and innovations which solves problems\nand breaks limitations which appear in solution of these very complex\nrevolutionary ideas.\n  Key word: AB levitator, levitation, non-rocket outer space flight, electric\nenergy storage, AB propulsion, AB engine, Bolonkin.\n",

Here, the results suggest that a simple planar\ninterface between semi-infinite air and a nonreciprocal material can achieve\nspatio-temporal manipulation of the electric field. In particular, this work\npresents three compelling scenarios for electromagnetic wave manipulation:\nradiation pattern redistribution (with closed-form expressions provided),\ncarrier-envelope phase control, and spatial profile control. The presented\nresults pave the way for electric field manipulation using pattern-free\nnonreciprocal materials.\n",

        "summary": "  There is growing interest in fully electric vehicles in the automotive\nindustry as it becomes increasingly more difficult to meet new and upcoming\nemission regulations based on internal combustion engines. Fully electric\nvehicles do not have an internal combustion engine. Hence, drive torque change\nfor a traction control system and for a yaw stability control system has to be\nthrough the electric motor used for traction. The regenerative braking\ncapability of fully electric vehicles has to be taken into account in designing\nbraking controllers like ABS and yaw stability control through differential\nbraking. Fully electric vehicles are usually lighter vehicles with different\ndynamic characteristics than that of their predecessors using internal\ncombustion engines. As such, their yaw stability control systems have to be\nre-designed and tested. This paper reports the initial results of ongoing work\non yaw stability controller design for a fully electric vehicle. Two different\nimplementations on a research prototype fully electric light commercial vehicle\nare considered. The first implementation uses the production yaw stability\ncontrol system in the internal combustion engine powered conventional vehicle.\nThe drive torque change commands from the production ECU are read, modified and\nsent to the electric motor driver in trying to mimic the conventional vehicle.\nThe differential braking commands are the same as in the conventional vehicle.\nIn the second implementation, a generic yaw stability control system that\ncalculates and issues its own drive torque change commands and differential\nbraking commands is designed and implemented. Offline simulations on a\nvalidated model and a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system are used in\ndesigning the yaw stability control system.\n",

The new research\ndirections in these two sciences are pointed out by comparison and in the\nperspective of future new solar devices. A parallel and the equivalence between\nelectronics and photonics are presented.

Solar energy could be converted in many ways, the most known is\nthe conversion in electricity. Today we need that the energy is in form of\nelectricity because most of the apparatus that we use are based on electricity:\ninformatics, motors, etc. However, the progress in photonics with optical\ncircuits, optical transistors etc., shows that the photonics informatics could\nbe possible.

Our exploration unveils a recursive relation\ninspired by the conjecture, manifesting chaotic behavior. Remarkably, we\ninterpret this derived chaotic dynamics as a unique representation of an\nelectrical system, providing a novel perspective within the domain of\nelectrical engineering. Beyond this groundbreaking derivation, our study delves\ninto the potential applications of chaos theory, bifurcation analysis, and\nentropy within the framework of this electrical system. We scrutinize the\nimplications of chaos for signal processing, conduct stability analysis through\nbifurcation studies, and investigate the role of entropy in quantifying the\nrandomness or predictability of electrical signals. Additionally, we explore\nenergy distribution aspects within the electrical system, shedding light on how\nchaotic dynamics influence energy dissipation and allocation. In the course of\nour research, a new finding emerged, contributing to our understanding of the\nderived chaotic dynamics. This discovery enhances the applicability of our\nframework within electrical engineering, paving the way for innovative\napplications and deeper explorations in the realm of system dynamics. Moreover,\nwe draw comparisons with the dynamics presented in our recent paper published\nin the European Physical Journal, specifically addressing Yitang Zhang's\ncontributions. This comparative analysis further underscores the unique\ncharacteristics and potential applications of the derived chaotic dynamics.\nThis study not only elucidates the intricate connection between chaotic\ndynamics and number theory but also offers a transformative perspective that\nextends the boundaries of conventional electrical system analysis\n",

It turns out that this\ncondition is not unique. We derive a simple analytic expression giving the\nrelation between the electrical load resistance of each generator permitting\noutput power maximization. We then focuse on the efficiency at maximum power\n(EMP) of the whole system to demonstrate that the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency may\nnot always be recovered: the EMP varies with the specific working conditions of\neach generator but remains in the range predicted by irreversible\nthermodynamics theory.

We describe different interface engineering strategies designed to\nreveal the origin of the electric and magnetic dead-layer at La0.67Sr0.33MnO3\ninterfaces. La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 is a key example of a strongly correlated\nperoskite oxide material in which a subtle balance of competing interactions\ngives rise to a ferromagnetic metallic groundstate. This balance, however, is\neasily disrupted at interfaces. We systematically vary the dopant profile, the\ndisorder and the oxygen octahedra rotations at the interface to investigate\nwhich mechanism is responsible for the dead layer. We find that the magnetic\ndead layer can be completely eliminated by compositional interface engineering\nsuch that the polar discontinuity at the interface is removed. This, however,\nleaves the electrical dead-layer largely intact. We find that deformations in\nthe oxygen octahedra network at the interface are the dominant cause for the\nelectrical dead layer.\n",

However,\nthe software does not impose any specific limitations preventing other uses. In\ncontrast to other open-source software based on the Finite Difference Time\nDomain (FDTD) method, elecode implements various thin wire modeling techniques\nwhich allow simulating complex objects consisting of wires. In addition,\nimplemented graphical user interface (GUI) helps modify models conveniently.\nThe software provides auxiliary numerical methods for simulations and\nmeasurements of the electrical soil properties, allows conducting\nlightning-related simulations (including those involving isolation breakdown\nmodels), and calculations of grounding characteristics. The part of the code\nresponsible for FDTD simulations is well tested in previous works. Recently,\nthe code was rewritten in order to add a convenient interface for using it as a\nlibrary, command-line program, or GUI program. Finally, the code was released\nunder an open-source license. The main capabilities of the software are\ndescribed in the work. Several simulation examples covering main software\nfeatures are presented. elecode is available at\nhttps://gitlab.com/dmika/elecode.\n",

The electrical conductivity of biological tissues can be measured\nthrough their sonication in a magnetic field: the vibration of the tissues\ninside the field induces an electrical current by Lorentz force. This current,\ndetected by electrodes placed around the sample, is proportional to the\nultrasonic pressure, to the strength of the magnetic field and to the\nelectrical conductivity gradient along the acoustic axis. By focusing at\ndifferent places inside the sample, a map of the electrical conductivity\ngradient can be established. In this study experiments were conducted on a\ngelatin phantom and on a beef sample, successively placed in a 300 mT magnetic\nfield and sonicated with an ultrasonic transducer focused at 21 cm emitting 500\nkHz bursts. Although all interfaces are not visible, in this exploratory study\na good correlation is observed between the electrical conductivity image and\nthe ultrasonic image. This method offers an alternative to detecting\npathologies invisible to standard ultrasonography.\n",

Atoms in Rydberg states have large\npolarizabilities, making them highly sensitive to electric fields. Therefore,\nstray electric fields can decohere these atoms, in addition to compromising the\nfidelity of engineered interactions between them. It is therefore essential to\ncancel these stray electric fields. Here we present a novel, simple, and\nhighly-compact electrode assembly, implemented in a glass cell-based vacuum\nchamber design, for stray electric field cancellation.

        "summary": "  Diesel electric generators are an inherent part of remote hybrid microgrids\nfound in remote regions of the world that provide primary frequency response\n(PFR) to restore system frequency during load or generation changes. However,\nwith inverter-based resources (IBR) integration into microgrids, the IBR\ncontrol provides a fast frequency response (FFR) to restore the system\nfrequency. Hence, supplementing PFR with FFR requires a sophisticated control\nsystem and a high fidelity diesel electric generator model to design these\ncontrol systems. In this work, a high-fidelity model of a diesel electric\ngenerator is developed. Its parameters are tuned using a surrogate optimization\nalgorithm by emulating its response during a load change to a 400 kVA\nCaterpillar C-15 diesel generator, similar to those found in remote microgrids.\nThe diesel electric generator model consists of a synchronous machine, DC4B\nexcitation with V/Hz limiter, and a proposed modified IEEE GGOV1\nengine-governor model (GGOV1D). The performance of the GGOV1D is compared with\nsimple, Woodward DEGOV, and a standard IEEE GGOV1 engine-governor model.\nResults show that error in the diesel electric generator's response to load\nchanges using the GGOV1D model is lower with an improved frequency response\nduring the arresting and rebound period than the other engine-governor models.\n",

        "summary": "  India, being one of the fastest growing economies of the world, must take a\nsustainable path for development. India is responsible for 7 percent of global\nCO2 emissions. The electricity sector accounts for nearly 35 percent of\nemissions from the country. The switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources\nis the key in decarbonizing this sector and is considered as the crucial step\nfor climate mitigation. This research investigates the potential of renewable\nenergy sources; wind, solar and hydro. The optimization model developed in this\nstudy analyzes various scenarios for the transition to a sustainable future.\nThe results show that India aims to achieve 450 GW of installed capacity from\nRES is far from a Net Zero future. Results confirm that India has the potential\nto meet 100 percent of electricity demand in 2030 from RES including wind,\nsolar and hydro. Introducing Social Cost of Carbon is a viable option to reduce\nemissions in India. However, due to the low cost of coal, high coal taxes do\nnot lead to reduced emissions.\n",

        "summary": "  This is a set of lecture notes of a course on statistical physics and\nthermodynamics, which is oriented, to a certain extent, towards electrical\nengineering students. The main body of the lectures is devoted to statistical\nphysics, whereas much less emphasis is given to the thermodynamics part. In\nparticular, the idea is to let the most important results of thermodynamics\n(most notably, the laws of thermodynamics) to be obtained as conclusions from\nthe derivations in statistical physics. Beyond the variety of central topics in\nstatistical physics that are important to the general scientific education of\nthe EE student, special emphasis is devoted to subjects that are vital to the\nengineering education concretely. These include, first of all, quantum\nstatistics, like the Fermi-Dirac distribution, as well as diffusion processes,\nwhich are both fundamental for deep understanding of semiconductor devices.\nAnother important issue for the EE student is to understand mechanisms of noise\ngeneration and stochastic dynamics in physical systems, most notably, in\nelectric circuitry. Accordingly, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of\nstatistical mechanics, which is the theoretical basis for understanding thermal\nnoise processes in systems, is presented from a signals--and--systems point of\nview, in a way that would hopefully be understandable and useful for an\nengineering student, and well connected to other courses in the electrcial\nengineering curriculum like courses on random priocesses. The quantum regime,\nin this context, is important too and hence provided as well. Finally, we touch\nvery briefly upon some relationships between statistical mechanics and\ninformation theory, which is the theoretical basis for communications\nengineering, and demonstrate how statistical-mechanical approach can be useful\nin order for the study of information-theoretic problems.\n",

        "title": "A Novel Approach for Optimal Trajectory Design with Multiple Operation\n  Modes of Propulsion System, Part 2",
        "summary": "  Equipping a spacecraft with multiple solar-powered electric engines (of the\nsame or different types) compounds the task of optimal trajectory design due to\npresence of both real-valued inputs (power input to each engine in addition to\nthe direction of thrust vector) and discrete variables (number of active\nengines). Each engine can be switched on/off independently and \"optimal\"\noperating power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which\ndepends on the distance from the Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth\nControl (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory optimization\nfrom the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated, which\npresents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of\nengine clusters with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be\noptimized. Moreover, engine clusters with different/mixed electric engines are\nconsidered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines. Remarkably, the\nCSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value\nproblem to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the\nresulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting solution scheme and with a random\ninitialization of the missing costates. While the approach we present is a\ncontinuous neighbor of the discontinuous extremals, we show that the\ndiscontinuous necessary conditions are satisfied in the asymptotic limit. We\nbelieve this is the first indirect method to accommodate a multi-mode control\nof this level of complexity with realistic engine performance curves. The\nresults are interesting and promising for dealing with a large family of such\nchallenging multi-mode optimal control problems.\n",

As an ideal, reversible engine, a single cycle must be performed in\ninfinite time, and so the Carnot engine has zero power. However, there is\nnothing in principle forbidding the existence of a heat engine whose efficiency\napproaches that of Carnot while maintaining finite power. Such an engine must\nhave very special properties, some of which have been discussed in the\nliterature, in various limits. While recent theorems rule out a large class of\nengines from maintaining finite power at exactly the Carnot efficiency, the\napproach to the limit still merits close study. Presented here is an exactly\nsolvable model of such an approach that may serve as a laboratory for\nexploration of the underlying mechanisms. The equations of state have their\norigins in the extended thermodynamics of electrically charged black holes.\n",

They utilize Coulomb's law and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nof statistical physics that is the reverse phenomenon of heat dissipation in a\nresistor. No steams, gases, liquids, photons, combustion, phase transition, or\nexhaust/pollution are present here. In these engines, instead of heat\nreservoirs, cylinders, pistons and valves, resistors, capacitors and switches\nare the building elements. For the best performance, a large number of parallel\nengines must be integrated to run in a synchronized fashion and the\ncharacteristic size of the elementary engine must be at the 10 nanometers\nscale. At room temperature, in the most idealistic case, a two-dimensional\nensemble of engines of 25 nanometer characteristic size integrated on a 2.5x2.5\ncm silicon wafer with 12 Celsius temperature difference between the warm-source\nand the cold-sink would produce a specific power of about 0.4 Watt. Regular and\ncoherent (correlated-cylinder states) versions are shown and both of them can\nwork in either four-stroke or two-stroke modes. The coherent engines have\nproperties that correspond to coherent quantum heat engines without the\npresence of quantum coherence.

        "summary": "  Strongly-coupled quantum dot molecules (QDMs) are widely deployed in the\ndesign of a variety of optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and quantum information\ndevices. An efficient and optimized performance of these devices demands\nengineering of the electronic and optical properties of the underlying QDMs.\nThe application of electric fields offers a knob to realise such control over\nthe QDM characteristics for a desired device operation. We perform\nmulti-million-atom atomistic tight-binding calculations to study the influence\nof electric fields on the electron and hole wave function confinements and\nsymmetries, the ground-state transition energies, the band-gap wavelengths, and\nthe optical transition modes. The electrical fields both parallel ($\\vec{E_p}$)\nand anti-parallel ($\\vec{E_a}$) to the growth direction are investigated to\nprovide a comprehensive guide on the understanding of the electric field\neffects. The strain-induced asymmetry of the hybridized electron states is\nfound to be weak and can be balanced by applying a small $\\vec{E_a}$ electric\nfield, of the order of 1 KV/cm. The strong interdot couplings completely break\ndown at large electric fields, leading to single QD states confined at the\nopposite edges of the QDM. This mimics a transformation from a type-I band\nstructure to a type-II band structure for the QDMs, which is a critical\nrequirement for the design of intermediate-band solar cells (IBSC). The\nanalysis of the field-dependent ground-state transition energies reveal that\nthe QDM can be operated both as a high dipole moment device by applying large\nelectric fields and as a high polarizibility device under the application of\nsmall electric field magnitudes.

We address three important issues\npertaining to EV charging and integration into the power system: (1) charging\nstation placement, (2) pricing policy and energy management strategy, and (3)\nelectricity trading market and distribution network design to facilitate\nintegrating EV and renewable energy source (RES) into the power system.\n  For charging station placement problem, we propose a multi-stage consumer\nbehavior based placement strategy with incremental EV penetration rates and\nmodel the EV charging industry as an oligopoly where the entire market is\ndominated by a few charging service providers (oligopolists). The optimal\nplacement policy for each service provider is obtained by solving a Bayesian\ngame.\n  For pricing and energy management of EV charging stations, we provide\nguidelines for charging service providers to determine charging price and\nmanage electricity reserve to balance the competing objectives of improving\nprofitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on the\npower system. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm\nand greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) are applied to derive the pricing\nand electricity procurement strategy.\n  We design a novel electricity trading market and distribution network, which\nsupports seamless RES integration, grid to vehicle (G2V), vehicle to grid\n(V2G), vehicle to vehicle (V2V), and distributed generation (DG) and storage.\nWe apply a sharing economy model to the electricity sector to stimulate\ndifferent entities to exchange and monetize their underutilized electricity.

We have implemented physical\nprinciples that separate the propulsion and steering mechanisms of active\nmotion using optically activated, patterned, photoresponsive semiconductor\ncoatings on intricate microstructures. Our engineered microswimmer robots\nemploy an induced-charge electro-phoresis (ICEP) mechanism to achieve linear\nmotion and optically modulated electrokinetic propulsion (OMEP) for steering.\nOptical modulation is achieved by manipulating the polarizability of patterned\nZnO semiconductor coating through exposure to light with wavelengths above its\nbandgap, exploiting the semiconductor's photoconductive properties. Unlike\nprevious methods that rely on changing the direction of optical illumination or\nspatially controlling narrow optical beams, our approach achieves optical\nsteering under uniform ambient illumination conditions, thereby greatly\nreducing the complexity of the optical system. The decoupling of propulsion and\nsteering allows for the programming of micromotor trajectories in both open and\nclosed-loop control modes. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way\nfor efficient optically gated control of the trajectory of photoresponsive\nactive particles. Furthermore, they will enable the selective manipulation of\nspecific subgroups of engineered active microparticles with various\nsemiconducting coatings having different band gaps.\n",

        "summary": "  Plasmonic resonances in metallic nanostructures have been shown to\ndrastically enhance local electromagnetic fields, and thereby increase the\nefficiency of nonlinear optical phenomena, such as second harmonic generation\n(SHG). While it has been experimentally observed that enhanced fields can\nsignificantly boost SHG, to date it proved difficult to probe electrical and\nmagnetic resonances in one and the same nanostructure. This however is\nnecessary to directly compare relative contributions of electrical and magnetic\ncomponents of SHG enhancement. In this paper we report an experimental study of\na metasurface capable of providing electrical and magnetic resonant SHG\nenhancement for TM polarization. Our metasurface could be engineered such that\nthe peak frequencies of electrical and magnetic resonances could be adjusted\nindependently. We used this feature to distinguish their relative\ncontributions. Experimentally it was observed that the magnetic resonance\nprovides only 50% as much enhancement to SHG as compared to the electric\nresonance. In addition aligning both resonances in frequency results in\nconversion efficiency of 1.32 x 10^(-10).\n",

As a result, charging stations may face\nserious congestion problems during peak traffic hours in the near future with\nthe rapid growth of plug-in electric vehicle population. Considering that\ndrivers' time costs are usually expensive, charging congestion will be a\ndominant factor that affect a charging station's quality of service. Hence, it\nis indispensable to conduct adequate congestion analysis when designing\ncharging stations in order to guarantee acceptable quality of service in the\nfuture. This paper proposes a data-driven approach for charging congestion\nanalysis of plug-in electric vehicle charging stations. Based on a data-driven\nplug-in electric vehicle charging station planning model, we adopt the queuing\ntheory to model and analyze the charging congestion phenomenon in these\nplanning results.

The main motivation of this paper is that future green fuels from\npower-to-X assets should be produced from power with the lowest possible\nemissions while still keeping the cost of electricity low. To this end we\npropose a power-to-X scheduling framework that is capable of co-optimizing CO2\nemission intensity and electricity prices in the day-ahead electricity market\nscheduling. Three realistic models for local production units are developed for\nflexible dispatch and the impact on electricity market scheduling is examined.\nFurthermore, the possible benefits of using CO2 emission intensity and\nelectricity prices trade-off in scheduling are discussed. We find that there is\na non-linear trade-off between CO2 emission intensity and cost, favoring a\nweighted optimization between the two objectives.\n",

        "summary": "  Static electric fields can be configured to guide charged nanoparticles along\nthe electric field lines. Some field line configurations can focus the\nnanoparticles to prescribed places thus acting as electric funnels. Despite the\nimportance of funnels for nanoprinting , there is a lack of formulation and\nunderstanding. We present two solvable models in two dimensions (2D) as far as\nit allows one to use the complex plane for exact calculation of the field\nlines. One model deals with two fixed dipoles such that the external electric\nfield tries to squeeze through between them thus forming a funnel. The other\none deals with a couple of parallel conducting plates with a hole where the\nexternal field comes through also creating a funnel. The results obtained may\nbe useful for configuring the electric field for nanoprinting engineering.\n",

        "title": "From local force-flux relationships to internal dissipations and their\n  impact on heat engine performance: The illustrative case of a thermoelectric\n  generator",
        "summary": "  We present an in-depth analysis of the sometimes understated role of the\nprinciple of energy conservation in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Our\ncase study is that of a thermoelectric generator (TEG), which is a heat engine\nof choice in irreversible thermodynamics, owing to the coupling between the\nelectrical and heat fluxes. We show why Onsager's reciprocal relations must be\nconsidered locally and how internal dissipative processes emerge from the\nextension of these relations to a global scale: the linear behavior of a heat\nengine at the local scale is associated with a dissipation process that must\npartake in the global energy balance. We discuss the consequences of internal\ndissipations on the so-called efficiency at maximum power, in the light of our\ncomparative analyses of exoreversibility and endoreversibility on the one hand,\nand of two classes of heat engines, autonomous and periodically-driven, on the\nother hand. Finally, basing our analysis on energy conservation, we also\ndiscuss recent works which claim the possibility to overcome the traditional\nboundaries on efficiency imposed by finite-time thermodynamics in\nthermoelectric systems with broken time-reversal symmetry; this we do by\nintroducing a \"thermal\" thermopower and an \"electrical\" thermopower which\npermits an analysis of the thermoelectric response of the TEG considering a\npossible dissymmetry between the electrical/thermal and the thermal/electrical\ncouplings.\n",

        "summary": "  Engineering the local density of states with nanophotonic structures is a\npowerful tool to control light-matter interactions via the Purcell effect. At\noptical frequencies, control over the electric field density of states is\ntypically used to couple to and manipulate electric dipole transitions.\nHowever, it is also possible to engineer the magnetic density of states to\ncontrol magnetic dipole transitions. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the optical magnetic Purcell effect using a single rare earth ion\ncoupled to a nanophotonic cavity. We engineer a new single photon emitter,\nEr$^{3+}$ in MgO, where the electric dipole decay rate is strongly suppressed\nby the cubic site symmetry, giving rise to a nearly pure magnetic dipole\noptical transition. This allows the unambiguous determination of a magnetic\nPurcell factor $P_m=1040 \\pm 30$. We further extend this technique to realize a\nmagnetic dipole spin-photon interface, performing optical spin initialization\nand readout of a single Er$^{3+}$ electron spin. This work demonstrates the\nfundamental equivalence of electric and magnetic density of states engineering,\nand provides a new tool for controlling light-matter interactions for a broader\nclass of emitters.\n",

The statistical analysis includes\n(i) non-Gaussianity (nG), which is a measure of the degree of temporal\ncorrelation in the noise, and (ii) ratio of integrated noise power to the DC\nleakage current (R). The occurrence of high peaks in nG indicates the\nappearance of new percolation paths, and the subsequent conduction through\nthese paths is indicated by R.

        "summary": "  By considering AdS charged black hole in the context of extended\nthermodynamic as the working substance we use it as a heat engine. We\ninvestigate the effect of hairy charge on the evolution of efficiency and\nCarnot efficiency along with electric charge. Because of interesting\nthermodynamic behavior of hairy black holes it would be natural to know their\neffects when we use black hole as a heat engine. We show that the hairy charge\nincreases the efficiency, and so maximum temperature would be happened for\nbigger Maxwell charge when this hairy charge grows. For the fixed electric\ncharges, the efficiency has a minimum value. In fact all critical points\ndescribe physical states except when the charge removed. If the electric charge\ntakes a zero value then the hairy charge must be negative. We also seek\nbehavior of the system for large charges which is provided a model with\nlow-temperature thermodynamics.\n",

This is inspired by the recent discovery of a decidable program\nlogic called Visibly Pushdown Fixpoint Logic with Chop which extends both the\nmodal mu-calculus and PDL over visibly pushdown languages, which, so far,\nconstituted the ends of two pillars of decidable program logics.\n  Here we show that this logic is not only more expressive than either of its\ntwo fragments, but in fact even more expressive than their union. Hence, the\ndecidability border amongst program logics has been properly pushed up. We\ncomplete the picture by providing results separating all the PDL-based and\nmodal fixpoint logics with regular, visibly pushdown and arbitrary context-free\nconstructions.\n",

In\nthis context, interaction between these two domains are investigated and the\nsize of the distributed energy resources in the MES is scaled to examine the\nimpact of sizing on the integrating networks and their controlling system. To\nachieve this, the paper uses sensitivity analysis and a meta-modeling\ntechnique, both incorporated in a toolbox for scaling analysis.

        "summary": "  A new electrostatic ramjet space engine is proposed and analyzed. The upper\natmosphere (85 -1000 km) is extremely dense in ions (millions per cubic cm).\nThe interplanetary medium contains positive protons from the solar wind. A\ncharged ball collects the ions (protons) from the surrounding area and a\nspecial electric engine accelerates the ions to achieve thrust or decelerates\nthe ions to achieve drag. The thrust may have a magnitude of several Newtons.\nIf the ions are decelerated, the engine produces a drag and generates\nelectrical energy. The theory of the new engine is developed. It is shown that\nthe proposed engine driven by a solar battery (or other energy source) can not\nonly support satellites in their orbit for a very long time but can also work\nas a launcher of space apparatus. The latter capability includes launch to high\norbit, to the Moon, to far space, or to the Earth atmosphere (as a return\nthruster for space apparatus or as a killer of space debris). The proposed\nramjet is very useful in interplanetary trips to far planets because it can\nsimultaneously produce thrust or drag and large electric energy using the solar\nwind. Two scenarios, launch into the upper Earth atmosphere and an\ninterplanetary trip, are simulated and the results illustrate the excellent\npossibilities of the new concept.\n",

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality that\ncan be used to determine these conductivities in vivo from boundary\nmeasurements.

The\nmagnitude of the electric field controls the trivial and topological insulator\nphases of the stanene. We investigate the effects of TPT in two types of\nthermodynamic cycles, with and without adiabatic stages. For the adiabatic\ncase, we examine a quantum Otto cycle. We find that at the critical point of\nTPT both work and efficiency plots with respect to the strength of the electric\nfield exhibit a kink. For a non-adiabatic case, we consider an idealized\nStirling type cycle with two isothermal and two isoelectric processes. We find\nno signatures of the TPT unless a voltage bias is introduced to restrict the\ninvolved energy bands to the electronic manifold above the Fermi level. In this\ncase, either above or below the critical point, both work and efficiency become\nzero depending on the relative magnitudes of the electric fields in the\nisoelectric stages.\n",

        "summary": "  High impedance RF coils, such as self-decoupled coils, reduce the\nelectromagnetic coupling between the coil elements and eliminates the use of\ncomplex decoupling technologies. Although the high impedance design promises\nexcellent decoupling between the coil elements, it also results in high\nelectric fields across the RF coil, leading to potential safety problems during\nimaging. It also causes B1 field asymmetry, ultimately leading to difficulties\nin imaging quantification. In this study, we propose and investigate using a\nhigh dielectric sheet to reduce the electric fields across the coil and achieve\nexcellent electromagnetic decoupling among the coil elements, thereby ensuring\nsafer MRI at ultra-high fields and maintaining high imaging performance.\n",

        "summary": "  Circuit diagrams have been used in electrical engineering for decades to\ndescribe the wiring of devices and facilities. They depict electrical\ncomponents in a symbolic and graph-based manner. While the circuit design is\nusually performed electronically, there are still legacy paper-based diagrams\nthat require digitization in order to be used in CAE systems. Generally,\nknowledge on specific circuits may be lost between engineering projects, making\nit hard for domain novices to understand a given circuit design. The\ngraph-based nature of these documents can be exploited by semantic\ntechnology-based reasoning in order to generate human-understandable\ndescriptions of their functional principles. More precisely, each electrical\ncomponent (e.g. a diode) of a circuit may be assigned a high-level function\nlabel which describes its purpose within the device (e.g. flyback diode for\nreverse voltage protection). In this paper, forward chaining rules are used for\nsuch a generation. The described approach is applicable for both CAE-based\ncircuits as well as raw circuits yielded by an image understanding pipeline.\nThe viability of the approach is demonstrated by application to an existing set\nof circuits.\n",

By focusing on the\ncore message coming out of Ethics in Mathematics, its target group, and\neducational philosophy, we set it into relation with \"Mathematics for Social\nJustice\" and Paul Ernest's recent work on ethics of mathematics. We conclude\nthat, although both Ethics in Mathematics and Mathematics for Social Justice\nappear antagonistic at first glance, they can be understood as complementary\nrather than competing educational strategies.\n",

        "summary": "  This article reviews the current state of teaching and learning mathematical\nmodeling in the context of sustainable development goals for education at the\ntertiary level. While ample research on mathematical modeling education and\npublished textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on\nmathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap\nby exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and\nsustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct\nrealms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting\nsustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and\nlearning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy\nthat enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday\nlife and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal\neducation. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling\nfor sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal\narts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related\nto sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can\nbe further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in\nthe literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to\nthe advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of\nsustainability.\n",

Important mathematical\nconcepts- such as the idea of number or the systems of numeration, whose formal\ndefinition is currently independent of Euclidean spaces -have in the\nIsodimensional Discrete Mathematics (IDM) their roots in the DESs. This\nmathematics, which arises largely from the discretization of traditional\nmathematics, presents its foundations and concepts differently from the\northodox way, so at first glance it may seem that the IDM could be an exotic\ntool, or perhaps just \"a simple curiosity.\" However, the IDM dis-crete\napproaches have a great theoretical repercussion on traditional mathematics.\n",

We give an account of what warrants mathematical\nrepresentation of phenomenal experience, derive a general mathematical\nframework which takes into account consciousness' epistemic context and study\nwhich mathematical structures some of the key characteristics of conscious\nexperience imply, showing precisely where mathematical approaches allow to go\nbeyond what the standard methodology can do. The result is a general\nmathematical framework for models of consciousness that can be employed in the\ntheory-building process.\n",

This program can produce conjectures which are not implied by\nexisting (published) theorems. Here we propose a new approach to push forward\nexisting mathematical research goals---using automated mathematical discovery\nsoftware. We suggest how to initiate and harness large-scale collaborative\nmathematics. We envision mathematical research labs similar to what exist in\nother sciences, new avenues for funding, new opportunities for training\nstudents, and a more efficient and effective use of published mathematical\nresearch.\n  And our experiment in graph theory can be imitated in many other areas of\nmathematical research. Big Mathematics is the idea of large, systematic,\ncollaborative research on problems of existing mathematical interest. What is\npossible when we put our skills, tools, and results together systematically?\n",

Recent\nworks on mathematical language focus either on representing stand-alone\nmathematical expressions, especially in their natural tree format, or\nmathematical reasoning in pre-trained natural language models. Existing works\non jointly modeling and generating natural and mathematical languages simply\ntreat mathematical expressions as text, without accounting for the rigid\nstructural properties of mathematical expressions. In this paper, we propose a\nseries of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and\ngenerate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of\nnode tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position\nembeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical\nexpressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically\nvalid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model\nMathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical\nexpression generation tasks.\n",

The possibility of higher-level mathematics\naccessible to humans is posited to be the analog for mathematical observers of\nthe perception of physical space for physical observers. A physicalized\nanalysis is given of the bulk limit of traditional axiomatic approaches to the\nfoundations of mathematics, together with explicit empirical metamathematics of\nsome examples of formalized mathematics. General physicalized laws of\nmathematics are discussed, associated with concepts such as metamathematical\nmotion, inevitable dualities, proof topology and metamathematical\nsingularities. It is argued that mathematics as currently practiced can be\nviewed as derived from the ruliad in a direct Platonic fashion analogous to our\nexperience of the physical world, and that axiomatic formulation, while often\nconvenient, does not capture the ultimate character of mathematics. Among the\nimplications of this view is that only certain collections of axioms may be\nconsistent with inevitable features of human mathematical observers. A\ndiscussion is included of historical and philosophical connections, as well as\nof foundational implications for the future of mathematics.\n",

Awareness\nof ethical and social responsibility amongst mathematicians and mathematics\neducators is a newly established field, and yet it is crucially important, if\nwe are to use mathematics for good and the avoidance of harm - in other words\nto use mathematics for justice, belonging, peace, care, education, lawmaking,\nbuilding, creativity, equity, connection, fairness, rulemaking and order. Here,\nwe present a way to extend ideas from ethics in the field of mathematics for\nmathematicians to the field of mathematics education for mathematics teachers,\naiming to contribute to this transdisciplinary work and to advance the field\nfurther. We also explore links to ideas of equity, and silence and voice,\ndrawing on the consequences of a deeper examination of the entanglements of\nmathematical-ethical dilemmas for mathematics teachers both inside and outside\nthe classroom.\n",

We address two challenges of investigating non-Western\nbased mathematics: where to look for mathematical knowledge, and how to decode\nit from cultural practices. These two hurdles are overcome by cluster analysis\nof the keywords of included studies. Existing research falls into two\ncategories: I. identification of mathematical concepts used in Indigenous\nsocieties, and II. systematizing identified mathematical concepts. Both\napproaches are essential for research on Indigenous mathematics to flourish, in\norder to empower Indigenous knowledge holders and deconstruct restrictive\ncolonial boundaries of mathematical knowledge and education.\n",

        "summary": "  In this paper, we argue that there are foundational dilemmas in theoretical\nphysics related to the concept of reality and the nature of mathematics in\nphysics. Physical theory is treated as a conceptual organism which develops\nunder the weight of its internal contradictions. The paper discusses in depth\nthe problem of objective reality in physics and its relation to scientific\npractice. Then, it explores the problematic relation between physical meaning\nand mathematics in modern physical theory, followed by a discussion of the\ntrend of contemporary physics to replace physical principles with pure\nmathematical principles. Finally, it discusses the problem of logical coherence\nin modern physical theory. The paper emphasizes the importance of resolving\nthese dilemmas to the proper practice of theoretical physics.\n",

However, some less visible but still\nnumerous groups of students are little studied. On the whole, the contents of\nPhysical Review Physics Education Research reveals a robust research community\nin physics education, but there is room for growth with respect to working with\ndifferent kinds of students and the interactions between student attributes and\nteaching methods.\n",

This assessment results from my forty year journey arguing and\nfighting to build sociophysics. My view on interdisciplinary physics has thus\nevolved jumping repeatedly to opposite directions before settling down to the\nfollowing claim: today physics is what is done by physicists who handle a\nproblem the \"physicist's way\". However the training of physicists should stay\nrestricted to inert matter. Yet adding a focus on the universality of the\nphysicist approach as a generic path to investigate a topic. Consequently,\ninterdisciplinary physics should become a cabinet of curiosities including an\nincubator. The cabinet of curiosities would welcome all one shots papers\nrelated to any kind of object provided it is co-authored at least by one\nphysicist. Otherwise the paper should uses explicitly technics from physics. In\ncase a topic gets many papers, it would be moved to the incubator to foster the\npotential emergence of a new appropriate subfield of physics. A process\nillustrated by the subsection social physics in Frontiers in physics.\n",

        "summary": "  The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics\n(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The\nphysical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime\nformalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra\ndimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many\nhidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of\napparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically\ndescribe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two\ntimelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out\nspacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The\ngauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a\nspacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a\nunification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and\nrelationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for\nthe presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.\n2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of\n1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the\nunified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In\nthese lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory\nformulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results\nobtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.\n",

        "summary": "  Studies on physics identity have shown that it is one of the main factors\nthat can predict a person's persistence in the field; therefore, studying\nphysics identity is critical to increase diversity within the field of physics\nand to understand what changes can allow more women and minorities to identify\nwith the field. In this study, we investigate informal physics programs as\nspaces for physics identity exploration. These programs provide unique\nconditions under which to study physics identity development along with other\nidentities. Informal physics spaces allow for voluntary engagement, as well as\nelements of agency and autonomy within the exploration of physics. Thus these\nspaces allow an identity to form outside of the constraints traditionally found\nin academic settings. In this work, we operationalized the Community of\nPractice (CoP) framework to study the development of physics identities within\nuniversity students who facilitate informal physics programs. We present the\nstories from two physics graduate students out of our sample to provide a\ncontext for testing the feasibility of the extended framework and to identify\nhow experiences within an informal physics program can shape physics identity\ndevelopment. This paper presents the operationalized constructs within the\nCommunity of Practice framework, how these constructs are applied to the\nnarrated experiences of our participants, and highlights how we can use this\nframework to understand the nuances of physics identity development as well as\nthe factors that can influence that development.\n",

In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for\nstudying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and\ndevelopmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer\ncells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.\nInversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to\ninfer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which\naffect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,\nknowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.\nDevelopmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular\nfunction, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.\nBesides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal\ntissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review\nillustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical\nmodels are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical\ntheorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure\nmathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer\nbiology.\n",

Today, however, theoretical biology\nhas generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.\nThis could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a\n\"data first\", rather than a \"theory first\", approach is preferred. Moreover,\ngenerating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.\nThis situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be\ndisentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology\nand medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological\nsciences. This paper makes the case for a \"philosophical biology\"\n(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology\n(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through\nphilosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of\ntheoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word \"theory\" and making\nuse of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural\nsciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given\nbiological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along\nwith a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or\nnot the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be\nsecondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final\ngoal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical\nframework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental\nstudies of the defined problem.\n",

Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological\nentities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors\nremains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive\nreasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the\nlogical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present\narticle describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations\nof biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the\nlanguage and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach\nassumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends\ndiscipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised\nthrough the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and\nasymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these\nfour concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.\nFour fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's\ntheory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes\nMendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism\nand deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts\nof natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their\nreproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to\nclarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major\ntheories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin\nof life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.\n",

Physics education researchers have\ninvestigated student problem solving for the last three decades. Although\nphysics and biology problems differ in structure and content, the instructional\npurposes align closely: explaining patterns and processes in the natural world\nand making predictions about physical and biological systems. In this paper, we\ndiscuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education\nresearchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving\nskills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically\nasked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the\ndevelopment of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills\nin problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems\nrequires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use\nin representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and\nverifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help\nbiology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how\nbiology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms\nand inspire new studies in biology education research.\n  (To appear in Cell Biology Education - Life Sciences Education)\n",

As such, it poses numerous ethical, legal, and social\nimplications (ELSI) for researchers and policy makers. Various efforts to\nensure socially responsible synthetic biology are underway. Policy making is\none regulatory avenue, and other initiatives have sought to embed social\nscientists and ethicists on synthetic biology projects. However, given the\nnascency of synthetic biology, the number of heterogeneous domains it spans,\nand the open nature of many ethical questions, it has proven challenging to\nestablish widespread concrete policies, and including social scientists and\nethicists on synthetic biology teams has met with mixed success.\n  This text proposes a different approach, asking instead is it possible to\ndevelop a well-performing recommender model based upon natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to connect synthetic biologists with information on the ELSI\nof their specific research? This recommender was developed as part of a larger\nproject building a Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) to accelerate\ndiscovery and exploration of the synthetic biology design space. Our approach\naims to distill for synthetic biologists relevant ethical and social scientific\ninformation and embed it into synthetic biology research workflows.\n",

While these calls reflect the increasingly\ninterdisciplinary nature of biology research, crossing disciplinary boundaries\nin the classroom carries epistemological challenges for both instructors and\nstudents. In this paper we expand on the construct of authenticity to better\ndescribe and understand disciplinary practices, in particular to examine those\nused in physics and biology courses. We then apply these ideas to examine an\nintroductory biology course that incorporates physics and mathematics. We\ncharacterize the uses of interdisciplinary tools in this biology course and\ncontrast them with the typical uses of these tools in physics courses. Finally,\nwe examine student responses to the use of mathematics and physics in this\ncourse, to better understand the challenges and consequences of using\ninterdisciplinary tools in introductory courses. We link these results to the\nreform initiatives of introductory physics courses for life-science students.\n",

As a result\nan integrated view of cell biology is evolving, where genetic and molecular\nfeatures are scrutinized hand in hand with physical and mechanical\ncharacteristics of cells. Physics of liquid crystals has emerged as a\nburgeoning new frontier in cell biology over the past few years, fueled by an\nincreasing identification of orientational order and topological defects in\ncell biology, spanning scales from subcellular filaments to individual cells\nand multicellular tissues. Here, we provide an account of most recent findings\nand developments together with future promises and challenges in this rapidly\nevolving interdisciplinary research direction.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have presented new\nopportunities for integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into\nbiological research and education. This study evaluated the capabilities of\nleading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, Claude2, and SenseNova, in\nanswering conceptual biology questions. The models were tested on a\n108-question multiple-choice exam covering biology topics in molecular biology,\nbiological techniques, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Among the\nmodels, GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the\ngreatest consistency across trials with different prompts. The results\nindicated GPT-4's proficiency in logical reasoning and its potential to aid\nbiology research through capabilities like data analysis, hypothesis\ngeneration, and knowledge integration. However, further development and\nvalidation are still required before the promise of LLMs in accelerating\nbiological discovery can be realized.\n",

Generative models, such as normalizing flows, have shown\nremarkable ability in approximating complex distributions in various domains.\nHowever, their application in systems biology for approximating intractable\nlikelihood functions remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate a framework for\nleveraging normalizing flows to approximate complex likelihood functions\ninherent to systems biology models. By using normalizing flows in the\nSimulation-based inference setting, we demonstrate a method that not only\napproximates a likelihood function but also allows for model inference in the\nmodel selection setting. We showcase the effectiveness of this approach on\nreal-world systems biology problems, providing practical guidance for\nimplementation and highlighting its advantages over traditional computational\nmethods.\n",

        "summary": "  Synthetic biology is the engineering of cellular networks. It combines\nprinciples of engineering and the knowledge of biological networks to program\nthe behavior of cells. Computational modeling techniques in conjunction with\nmolecular biology techniques have been successful in constructing biological\ndevices such as switches, oscillators, and gates. The ambition of synthetic\nbiology is to construct complex systems from such fundamental devices, much in\nthe same way electronic circuits are built from basic parts. As this ambition\nbecomes a reality, engineering concepts such as interchangeable parts and\nencapsulation will find their way into biology. We realize that there is a need\nfor computational tools that would support such engineering concepts in\nbiology. As a solution, we have developed the software Athena that allows\nbiological models to be constructed as modules. Modules can be connected to one\nanother without altering the modules themselves. In addition, Athena houses\nvarious tools useful for designing synthetic networks including tools to\nperform simulations, automatically derive transcription rate expressions, and\nview and edit synthetic DNA sequences. New tools can be incorporated into\nAthena without modifying existing program via a plugin interface, IronPython\nscripts, Systems Biology Workbench interfacing and the R statistical language.\nThe program is currently for Windows operating systems, and the source code for\nAthena is made freely available through CodePlex, www.codeplex.com/athena.\n",

        "summary": "  Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular since the work by E.\nNoether and H. Weyl in the first half of last century. Herein, we briefly\nreview their role by recalling how symmetry changes allow to conceptually move\nfrom classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We then introduce our\nongoing theoretical analysis in biology and show that symmetries play a\nradically different role in this discipline, when compared to those in current\nphysics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in\nrelation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the\ntheories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various\nlevels of organization, are not \"just\" processes, but permanent (extended, in\nour terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the\nlimits of a relative structural stability (or interval of viability),\nvariability is at the core of these transitions.\n",

At present, it\nis not yet clear what will emerge as the defining principles of Synthetic\nBiology. One proposed approach is to build Synthetic Biology around the\nclassical engineering principles of standardization, modularity/decoupling and\nabstraction/modeling to facilitate component-based design. In this article we\nsuggest and discuss an alternative paradigm, which we call High-throughput\nBiologically Optimized Search Engineering (HT-BOSE). Stemming from directed\nevolution, in HT-BOSE the focal point is a biological knowledge based rational\noptimization of the search process in the space of device design possibilities.\nThe HT-BOSE approach may also be relevant in other contexts and we briefly\nhighlight how it could be applicable to the development of multi-drug cocktails\nin a biomedical setting.\n",

I argue for a\n\"mechanism-plus-X\" paradigm, where mainstay elements of mechanistic models such\nas hierarchy and correlation are combined with nomological principles such as\ngeneral operative rules and generative principles. Depending on the question at\nhand and the nature of the inquiry, X could range from proven physical laws to\nspeculative biological generalizations, such as the notional principle of\ncellular synchrony.

Synthetic biology allows us to\nbioengineer cells to synthesize novel valuable molecules such as renewable\nbiofuels or anticancer drugs. However, traditional synthetic biology approaches\ninvolve ad-hoc engineering practices, which lead to long development times.\nHere, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages\nmachine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide synthetic\nbiology in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic\nunderstanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART\nprovides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering\ncycle, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of ART on simulated data sets, as well as\nexperimental data from real metabolic engineering projects producing renewable\nbiofuels, hoppy flavored beer without hops, and fatty acids. Finally, we\ndiscuss the limitations of this approach, and the practical consequences of the\nunderlying assumptions failing.\n",

Toward improving the reproducibility of computational systems\nresearch, we identified several resources that investigators can leverage to\nmake their research more accessible, executable, and comprehensible by others.\nIn particular, we identified several domain standards and curation services, as\nwell as powerful approaches pioneered by the software engineering industry that\nwe believe many investigators could adopt.

The first part of the\nsolution proposed here is to limit statistical hypothesis testing to the small\nsubset of experiments where a biologically meaningful null hypotheses can be\ndefined prior to the experiment. The second part of the solution is to make\nconfidence intervals the default statistic in cell biology.\n",

        "summary": "  Composition is a powerful principle for systems biology, focused on the\ninterfaces, interconnections, and orchestration of distributed processes to\nenable integrative multiscale simulations. Whereas traditional models focus on\nthe structure or dynamics of specific subsystems in controlled conditions,\ncompositional systems biology aims to connect these models, asking critical\nquestions about the space between models: What variables should a submodel\nexpose through its interface? How do coupled models connect and translate\nacross scales? How do domain-specific models connect across biological and\nphysical disciplines to drive the synthesis of new knowledge? This approach\nrequires robust software to integrate diverse datasets and submodels, providing\nresearchers with tools to flexibly recombine, iteratively refine, and\ncollaboratively expand their models. This article offers a comprehensive\nframework to support this vision, including: a conceptual and graphical\nframework to define interfaces and composition patterns; standardized schemas\nthat facilitate modular data and model assembly; biological templates that\nintegrate detailed submodels that connect molecular processes to the emergence\nof the cellular interface; and user-friendly software interfaces that empower\nresearch communities to construct and improve multiscale models of cellular\nsystems. By addressing these needs, compositional systems biology will foster a\nunified and scalable approach to understanding complex cellular systems.\n",

It can have immediate\nimplications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.\nBased on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful\nquantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S\nWright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology\nand by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by\nmainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found\nits increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the\nmodeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous\nnetwork of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe\nthe robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five\nlandmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important\ncommon thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few\nrecent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of\nadaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what\nneeded for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive\nlandscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an\nessential aspect of biological dynamical processes. Still, many important open\nproblems remain to be solved. Having this important problem under control, we\nmay expect that we are on the right road to quantitatively formulate the\nevolutionary dynamics discovered by Darwin and Wallace.\n",

        "summary": "  A common feature of the recent calls for reform of the undergraduate biology\ncurriculum has been for better coordination between biology and the courses\nfrom the allied disciplines of mathematics, chemistry, and physics. Physics has\nlagged math and chemistry in creating new biologically oriented curricula,\nthough much activity is now taking place and significant progress is being\nmade. In this article we consider a case study: a multi-year conversation\nbetween a physicist interested in adapting his physics course for biologists\n(Redish) and a biologist interested in including more physics in his biology\ncourse (Cooke). These extended discussions have led us both to a deeper\nunderstanding of each others' discipline and to significant changes in the way\nwe each think about and present our classes. We discuss two examples in detail:\nthe creation of a physics problem for a biology class on fluid flow, and the\ncreation of a biologically authentic physics problem on scaling and dimensional\nanalysis. In each case, we see differences in how the two disciplines frame and\nsee value in the tasks. We conclude with some generalizations about how biology\nand physics look at the world differently that help us navigate the minefield\nof counterproductive stereotypical responses.\n",

In plasmas they lead to thermodynamic instability similar to the\nliquid-gas phase transition of simple molecular fluids. For charged colloidal\nsuspensions the electrostatic correlations are responsible for screening and\ncolloidal charge renormalization. In aqueous solutions containing multivalent\ncounterions they can lead to charge inversion and flocculation. In biological\nsystems the correlations account for the organization of cytoskeleton and the\ncompaction of genetic material. In spite of their ubiquity, the true importance\nof electrostatic correlations has become fully appreciated only quite recently.\nIn this paper, I will review the thermodynamic consequences of electrostatic\ncorrelations in a variety of systems ranging from classical plasmas to\nmolecular biology.\n",

To emphasize the role that feedback theory\nwill play in understanding personalised medicine, we use the term feedback\nmedicine to describe the issues outlined.In these notes we consider feedback\nand control systems concepts applied to two important themes in medical systems\nbiology - personalised medicine and combinatorial intervention.

In our derivation, the master equation gives the jump\npart of the Markov process while the Fokker-Planck equation gives the\ncontinuous part. We thereby sketch a {}``family tree'' for stochastic models in\nsystems biology, providing explicit derivations of their formal relationship\nand clarifying assumptions involved.\n",

While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)\nmodel various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general\nmathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes\nthe students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'\nas well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to\ndescribe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different\nbranches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be\ntransitive but non-commutative. It is found that a hierarchical nature of\ndependence amongst the biological contexts models the emergent biological\nproperties efficiently. Reasons for these findings are provided with a general\nmodel to describe biological reality. Scheme to algorithmically implement the\nhierarchic structure of organization of biological contexts was achieved with a\nconstruct named 'Context tree'. A 'Context tree' based analysis of context\ninteractions among biophysical factors influencing protein structure was\nperformed.\n",

The thesis that they do not lead to a conceptual understanding of\nlife and biological systems is defended. Maturana and Varela's concept of\nautopoiesis is briefly sketched and its logical circularity avoided by\npostulating the existence of underlying {\\it living processes}, entailing\namplification from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, with increasing\ncomplexity in the passage from one scale to the other. Following such a line of\nthought, the currently accepted model of condensed matter, which is based on\nelectrostatics and short-ranged forces, is criticized. It is suggested that the\ncorrect interpretation of quantum dispersion forces (van der Waals, hydrogen\nbonding, and so on) as quantum coherence effects hints at the necessity of\nincluding long-ranged forces (or mechanisms for them) in condensed matter\ntheories of biological processes. Some quantum effects in biology are reviewed\nand quantum mechanics is acknowledged as conceptually important to biology\nsince without it most (if not all) of the biological structures and signalling\nprocesses would not even exist. Moreover, it is suggested that long-range\nquantum coherent dynamics, including electron polarization, may be invoked to\nexplain signal amplification process in biological systems in general.\n",

Using new concepts, we were able to discovery new genomic\nrules that seem to be invariant across a large set of organisms, and show a\nfractal-like property, since no matter the scale, the same pattern is observed\n(self-similarity).

        "summary": "  One need only compare the number of three-dimensional molecular illustrations\nin the first (1990) and third (2004) editions of Voet & Voet's \"Biochemistry\"\nin order to appreciate this field's profound communicative value in modern\nbiological sciences -- ranging from medicine, physiology, and cell biology, to\npharmaceutical chemistry and drug design, to structural and computational\nbiology. The clich\\'e about a picture being worth a thousand words is quite\npoignant here: The information 'content' of an effectively-constructed piece of\nmolecular graphics can be immense. Because biological function arises from\nstructure, it is difficult to overemphasize the utility of visualization and\ngraphics in molding our current understanding of the molecular nature of\nbiological systems. Nevertheless, creating effective molecular graphics is not\neasy -- neither conceptually, nor in terms of effort required. The present\ncollection of Rules is meant as a guide for those embarking upon their first\nmolecular illustrations.\n",

        "summary": "  Although the traits emerged in a mass gathering are often non-deliberative,\nthe act of mass impulse may lead to irre- vocable crowd disasters. The two-fold\nincrease of carnage in crowd since the past two decades has spurred significant\nadvances in the field of computer vision, towards effective and proactive crowd\nsurveillance. Computer vision stud- ies related to crowd are observed to\nresonate with the understanding of the emergent behavior in physics (complex\nsystems) and biology (animal swarm). These studies, which are inspired by\nbiology and physics, share surprisingly common insights, and interesting\ncontradictions. However, this aspect of discussion has not been fully explored.\nTherefore, this survey provides the readers with a review of the\nstate-of-the-art methods in crowd behavior analysis from the physics and\nbiologically inspired perspectives. We provide insights and comprehensive\ndiscussions for a broader understanding of the underlying prospect of blending\nphysics and biology studies in computer vision.\n",

Thus far,\none tumor has been viewed as a whole entity in cancer functional studies. With\nthe advances of genome sequencing and computational analysis, we are able to\nquantify and computationally dissect clones from tumors, and then conduct\nclone-based analysis. Emerging technologies such as single-cell genome\nsequencing and RNA-Seq could profile tumor clones. Thus, we should reconsider\nhow to conduct cancer systems biology studies in the genome sequencing era. We\nwill outline new directions for conducting cancer systems biology by\nconsidering that genome sequencing technology can be used for dissecting,\nquantifying and genetically characterizing clones from tumors. Topics discussed\nin Part 1 of this review include computationally quantifying of tumor\nsubpopulations; clone-based network modeling, cancer hallmark-based networks\nand their high-order rewiring principles and the principles of cell survival\nnetworks of fast-growing clones.\n",

We describe how this shift demonstrates (1) a\nstronger identification with physics, (2) a more mixed affective stance towards\nphysics, and (3) more expert-like ways of knowing in physics. We argue that\nrecruiting the students relationship with biology into experiences of learning\nphysics impacted her relationship with physics as well as her sense of how\nphysics and biology are linked.\n",

        "summary": "  This chapter presents a history of international trade finance - the oldest\ndomain of international finance - from its emergence in the Middle Ages up to\ntoday. We describe how the structure and governance of the global trade finance\nmarket changed over time and how trade credit instruments evolved. Trade\nfinance products initially consisted of idiosyncratic assets issued by local\nmerchants and bankers. The financing of international trade then became\nincreasingly centralized and credit instruments were standardized through the\ndiffusion of the local standards of consecutive leading trading centres\n(Antwerp, Amsterdam, London). This process of market centralization/product\nstandardization culminated in the nineteenth century when London became the\nglobal centre for international trade finance and the sterling bill of exchange\nemerged as the most widely used trade finance instrument. The structure of the\ntrade finance market then evolved considerably following the First World War\nand disintegrated during the interwar de-globalization and Bretton Woods\nperiod. The reconstruction of global trade finance in the post-1970 period gave\nway to the decentralized market structure that prevails nowadays.\n",

        "summary": "  Supply Chain Finance is very important for supply chain competition, which is\nan important tool to activate the capital flow in the supply chain. Supply\nChain Finance-related research can support multiple applications and services,\nsuch as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk management, and\noptimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of\nBlockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in\nfinance. With the characteristics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof,\ncryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization, Blockchain fits\nwell with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data\nintegrity, authenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is\ntime to summarize the applications of Blockchain technology in the field of\nSupply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings to Supply Chain Finance\nis not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit\ndisassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance\noperations through smart contracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in\ncombination with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud\ncomputing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work in\nBlockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain\nFinance oriented applications, but most of these work are at the management\nlevel to propose conceptual frameworks or simply use Blockchain without\nexploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic reviews\nproviding a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of\nBlockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. In this paper, we ...\n",

While\ndigital finance has brought financial inclusion, it has also increased the risk\nof households falling into a debt trap. We provide evidence that supports this\nnotion and explain the channel through which digital finance increases the\nlikelihood of financial distress. Our results show that the widespread use of\ndigital finance increases credit market participation. The broadened access to\ncredit markets increases household consumption by changing the marginal\npropensity to consume. However, the easier access to credit markets also\nincreases the risk of households falling into a debt trap.\n",

For that this note simulates two scenarios which start with\nthe following baseline scenario: a State, with a set of hospitals, each with\nall types of wards at a basic level. The evolution of this baseline scenario\nconsists in the evolution of hospitals, that is, in the possibility of\nhospitals to make some of their wards excel. The State has a budget, for the\nevolution of this baseline scenario, which can be used by two financing\nsystems: either by a \"local financing\", i.e., by splitting the budget among the\nhospitals so that each hospital is managing its own portion of the budget by\npursuing the individual benefit, or by a \"central financing\", i.e., by not\nsplitting the budget among the hospitals so that the State is the sole manager\nof the budget, by pursuing the benefit of the whole community. The conclusions\nseem to be that: in the local financing system hospitals tend to diversify\ntheir excellences, while in the central financing system the State tends to\ncreate poles of excellence.\n",

This research utilizes data\nsourced from the Chinese General Social Survey and the Digital Financial\nInclusion Index to scrutinize the influence of digital finance on the gender\nwage disparity in China. The findings reveal that digital finance reduces the\ngender wage gap, and this conclusion remains robust after addressing\nendogeneity problem using instrumental variable methods. Further analysis of\nthe underlying mechanisms indicates that digital finance facilitates female\nentrepreneurship by lowering financing barriers, thereby promoting employment\nopportunities for women and also empowering them to negotiate higher wages.\nSpecially, digital finance enhances women's bargaining power within domestic\nsettings, therefore exerts a positive influence on the wages of women.\nSub-sample regressions demonstrate that women from economically disadvantaged\nbackgrounds, with lower human capital, benefit more from digital finance,\nunderscoring its inclusive nature. This study provides policy evidence for\nempowering vulnerable groups to increase their wages and addressing the\npersistent issue of gender income disparity in the labor market.\n",

As it is well known this results in a partial integro-differential\nequation (PIDE) that usually does not allow an analytical solution while\nnumerical solution brings some problems. In this paper we elaborate a new\napproach on how to transform the PIDE to some class of so-called\npseudo-parabolic equations which are known in mathematics but are relatively\nnew for mathematical finance.

In\ntoday's globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation's public debt\nlandscape can have significant impacts on that of international finances,\nnecessitating a nuanced understanding of the correlations between international\nand national markets to help investors make informed investment decisions.\nTherefore, by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this\nstudy utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US and\nInternational Public Finances and predict the changes in international public\nfinances based on the changes in US public finances. With the neural network\nmodel achieving a commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is\nable to affirm a discernible correlation and also plot the effect of US market\nvolatility on international markets. To further test the accuracy and\nsignificance of the model, an economic analysis was conducted that aimed to\ncorrelate the changes seen by the results of the model with historical stock\nmarket changes. This model demonstrates significant potential for investors to\npredict changes in international public finances based on signals from US\nmarkets, marking a significant stride in comprehending the intricacies of\nglobal public finances and the role of artificial intelligence in decoding its\nmultifaceted patterns for practical forecasting.\n",

The error in the\nfirst paper is avoided when clearly distinguishing between price processes,\ndividend processes and gain processes. We present an outline of the derivation\nthat yields the correct statement of the self-financing condition, clarifying\nthe structure of the relevant funding accounts, and show that the final result\nin \"Funding beyond discounting\" is correct, even if the self-financing\ncondition stated is not.\n",

The papers are categorized according to the following families of\ndomains: (i) Banking, (ii) Finance and its subdomains such as corporate\nfinance, governance finance including financial risk and financial policy,\nfinancial economics, and Behavioral finance, and (iii) Insurance. Further, the\npaper covers the primary ingredients of causal inference namely, statistical\nmethods such as Bayesian Causal Network, Granger Causality and jargon used\nthereof such as counterfactuals. The review also recommends some important\ndirections for future research. In conclusion, we observed that the application\nof causal inference in the banking and insurance sectors is still in its\ninfancy, and thus more research is possible to turn it into a viable method.\n",

It\ndocuments our pipeline approach of fine-tuning a foundation model into a\ntask-specific model for Financial Text Summarization. It involves (1) adapting\nLlama3 8B, a foundation model, to the Finance domain via continued\npre-training, (2) multi-task instruction-tuning to further equip the model with\nmore finance-related capabilities, (3) finally fine-tuning the model into a\ntask-specific `expert'.

        "summary": "  Supply chains lend themselves to blockchain technology, but certain\nchallenges remain, especially around invoice financing. For example, the\nfurther a supplier is removed from the final consumer product, the more\ndifficult it is to get their invoices financed. Moreover, for competitive\nreasons, retailers and manufacturers do not want to disclose their supply\nchains. However, upstream suppliers need to prove that they are part of a\n`stable' supply chain to get their invoices financed, which presents the\nupstream suppliers with huge, and often unsurmountable, obstacles to get the\nnecessary finance to fulfil the next order, or to expand their business. Using\na fictitious supply chain use case, which is based on a real world use case, we\ndemonstrate how these challenges have the potential to be solved by combining\nmore advanced and specialised blockchain technologies with other technologies\nsuch as Artificial Intelligence. We describe how atomic crosschain\nfunctionality can be utilised across private blockchains to retrieve the\ninformation required for an invoice financier to make informed decisions under\nuncertainty, and consider the effect this decision has on the overall stability\nof the supply chain.\n",

The techniques of transportation and\nreproducing kernels lead us to a very efficient methodology for numerical\nsimulations in many practical applications, and provide some light on the\nmethods used by the artificial intelligence community. For applications in the\nfinance industry, our method allows us to compute many types of risk measures\nwith an accurate and fast algorithm. We propose theoretical arguments as well\nas extensive numerical tests in order to justify sharp convergence rates,\nleading to rather optimal computational times. Cases of direct interest in\nfinance support our claims and the importance of the problem of the curse of\ndimensionality in finance applications is briefly discussed.\n",

        "title": "Choosing the Right Return Distribution and the Excess Volatility Puzzle",
        "summary": "  Proponents of behavioral finance have identified several \"puzzles\" in the\nmarket that are inconsistent with rational finance theory. One such puzzle is\nthe \"excess volatility puzzle\". Changes in equity prices are too large given\nchanges in the fundamentals that are expected to change equity prices. In this\npaper, we offer a resolution to the excess volatility puzzle within the context\nof rational finance. We empirically show that market inefficiency attributable\nto the volatility of excess return across time is caused by fitting an improper\ndistribution to the historical returns. Our results indicate that the variation\nof gross excess returns is attributable to poorly fitting the tail of the\nreturn distribution and that the puzzle disappears by employing a more\nappropriate distribution for the return data. The new distribution that we\nintroduce in this paper that better fits the historical return distribution of\nstocks explains the excess volatility in the market and thereby explains the\nvolatility puzzle. Failing to estimate the historical returns using the proper\ndistribution is only one possible explanation for the existence of the\nvolatility puzzle. However, it offers statistical models within the rational\nfinance framework which can be used without relying on behavioral finance\nassumptions when searching for an explanation for the volatility puzzle.\n",

        "title": "Robust asymptotic insurance-finance arbitrage",
        "summary": "  In most cases, insurance contracts are linked to the financial markets, such\nas through interest rates or equity-linked insurance products. To motivate an\nevaluation rule in these hybrid markets, Artzner et al. (2022) introduced the\nnotion of insurance-finance arbitrage. In this paper we extend their setting by\nincorporating model uncertainty. To this end, we allow statistical uncertainty\nin the underlying dynamics to be represented by a set of priors $\\mathscr{P}$.\nWithin this framework we introduce the notion of robust asymptotic\ninsurance-finance arbitrage and characterize the absence of such strategies in\nterms of the concept of ${Q}\\mathscr{P}$-evaluations. This is a nonlinear\ntwo-step evaluation which guarantees no robust asymptotic insurance-finance\narbitrage. Moreover, the ${Q}\\mathscr{P}$-evaluation dominates all two-step\nevaluations as long as we agree on the set of priors $\\mathscr{P}$ which shows\nthat those two-step evaluations do not allow for robust asymptotic\ninsurance-finance arbitrages. Furthermore, we introduce a doubly stochastic\nmodel under uncertainty for surrender and survival. In this setting, we\ndescribe conditional dependence by means of copulas and illustrate how the\n${Q}\\mathscr{P}$-evaluation can be used for the pricing of hybrid insurance\nproducts.\n",

This\nsurvey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications\nand frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity,\nmulti-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an\nintriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and\nRL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning\nmethods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions.\nThis survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative\nFinance.

        "summary": "  This research examines relationship between staging of Venture Capital (VC)\ninvestments and social feedback visible in publicly available data on the Web.\nWe address the question of Venture Capital investment sensitivity to\nperformance and prospects of new venture, given as likelihood of obtaining\nfuture financing, available exit options and duration between investment\nrounds. We argue that in the case of Internet companies, publicly available\nsocial feedback data, such as search trends and website traffic information,\ncan be used as a proxy for some of company's internal metrics such as user base\ngrowth and product adoption. In order to answer questions of interest, we\ncompile unique dataset consisting of detailed information about Venture Capital\ninvestments in the Internet Technology sector over the period from 2004 to 2012\nand associated longitudinal search trend and website traffic data. By applying\nmethods of survival analysis, we find that positive trends in search and\nwebsite traffic volumes can lead to increased likelihood of future financing\nand shortening of duration between subsequent financing rounds. We also find\nevidence that social feedback only impacts company's ability to attract next\nround of financing or exit via IPO, while M&A exits seem relatively independent\nof such performance metrics and can occur at any stage of company development.\nSuch findings provide strong evidence in support of learning hypothesis and\nsuggest VC's ability to identify prospects of new venture early in it's\ndevelopment and allocate funding accordingly. Given research also provides\nmethodological contributions to the problem of evaluating the prospects of new\nstartup companies using only publicly available data, and as such should be of\ninterest in applications such as new investment screening and industry-level\nassessments by analysts or policy makers.\n",

        "title": "A Rational Finance Explanation of the Stock Predictability Puzzle",
        "summary": "  In this paper, we address one of the main puzzles in finance observed in the\nstock market by proponents of behavioral finance: the stock predictability\npuzzle. We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance\nwhich can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model\nthe predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock\nreturns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,\nwe analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices\nby defining a forward-looking measure which we call \"implied excess\npredictability\". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's\npredictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing\nfunction of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These\nempirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices\nby spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price\nsignificantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the\nunderlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing\nformula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return\npredictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock\nreturn predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,\nspot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of\nthe stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find\nthat the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk\npremium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.\n",

While in\nother areas of applications the FPT problem can often be solved analytically,\nin finance we usually have to resort to the application of numerical\nprocedures, in particular when we deal with jump-diffusion stochastic processes\n(JDP).

The developed methodology is tested by using different\nparameters, the simulation results indicate that the developed methodology is\nmuch more efficient than the conventional Monte Carlo method.

However, existing works mainly adopt the\ncoarse-grained events, which loses the specific semantic information of diverse\nevent types. In this work, we propose to incorporate the fine-grained events in\nstock movement prediction. Firstly, we propose a professional finance event\ndictionary built by domain experts and use it to extract fine-grained events\nautomatically from finance news. Then we design a neural model to combine\nfinance news with fine-grained event structure and stock trade data to predict\nthe stock movement. Besides, in order to improve the generalizability of the\nproposed method, we design an advanced model that uses the extracted\nfine-grained events as the distant supervised label to train a multi-task\nframework of event extraction and stock prediction. The experimental results\nshow that our method outperforms all the baselines and has good\ngeneralizability.\n",

We document that the field has vastly expanded regarding\noutlets and published articles. Teams have become larger, and the proportion of\nwomen participating in research has increased significantly. Using the\nStructural Topic Model, we identify 45 topics discussed in the literature. We\ninvestigate the topic coverage of individual journals and can identify highly\nspecialized and generalist outlets, but our analyses reveal that most journals\nhave covered more topics over time, thus becoming more generalist. Finally, we\nfind that articles with at least one woman author focus more on topics related\nto social and governance aspects of corporate finance. We also find that teams\nwith at least one top-tier institution scholar tend to focus more on\ntheoretical aspects of finance.\n",

        "summary": "  When pricing options, there may be different views on the instantaneous mean\nreturn of the underlying price process. According to Black (1972), where there\nexist heterogeneous views on the instantaneous mean return, this will result in\narbitrage opportunities. Behavioral finance proponents argue that such\nheterogenous views are likely to occur and this will not impact option pricing\nmodels proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory and will not give rise\nto volatility smiles. To rectify this, a leading advocate of behavioral finance\nhas proposed a behavioral option pricing model. As there may be unexplored\nlinks between the behavioral and rational approaches to option pricing, in this\npaper we revisit Shefrin (2008) option pricing model as an example and suggest\none approach to modify this behavioral finance option pricing formula to be\nconsistent with rational dynamic asset pricing theory by introducing arbitrage\ntransaction costs which offset the gains from arbitrage trades.\n",

To introduce the core of the method, we\nconsider multilayer heat equations, known in physics for a relatively long time\nbut never used when solving financial problems. Thus, we expand the analytic\nmachinery of quantitative finance by augmenting it with the ML method. We\ndemonstrate how one can solve various problems of mathematical finance by using\nour approach. Specifically, we develop efficient algorithms for pricing barrier\noptions for time-dependent one-factor short-rate models, such as\nBlack-Karasinski and Verhulst. Besides, we show how to solve the well-known\nDupire equation quickly and accurately. Numerical examples confirm that our\napproach is considerably more efficient for solving the corresponding partial\ndifferential equations than the conventional finite difference method by being\nmuch faster and more accurate than the known alternatives.\n",

However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital\nmarkets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting\nat best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this work, we critically\nassess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of\nempirical finance and financial econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of\ncompeting causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey\nrelationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of\nempirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated\nonce we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be\nlimited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions.

The rise\nof blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined\nevolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting\nopportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market\nmisconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by\naddressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by\ndiscussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of\nnovel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and\ntaxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis\nand empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi,\nshedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we\ninvestigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for\nDeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need\nenhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the\nregulatory perimeter.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper proposes a novel method for constructing instruction-tuned large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for finance without instruction data. Traditionally,\ndeveloping such domain-specific LLMs has been resource-intensive, requiring a\nlarge dataset and significant computational power for continual pretraining and\ninstruction tuning. Our study proposes a simpler approach that combines\ndomain-specific continual pretraining with model merging. Given that\ngeneral-purpose pretrained LLMs and their instruction-tuned LLMs are often\npublicly available, they can be leveraged to obtain the necessary instruction\ntask vector. By merging this with a domain-specific pretrained vector, we can\neffectively create instruction-tuned LLMs for finance without additional\ninstruction data. Our process involves two steps: first, we perform continual\npretraining on financial data; second, we merge the instruction-tuned vector\nwith the domain-specific pretrained vector. Our experiments demonstrate the\nsuccessful construction of instruction-tuned LLMs for finance. One major\nadvantage of our method is that the instruction-tuned and domain-specific\npretrained vectors are nearly independent. This independence makes our approach\nhighly effective. The Japanese financial instruction-tuned LLMs we developed in\nthis study are available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/pfnet/nekomata-14b-pfn-qfin-inst-merge.\n",

In many cases\nprices, volatility and other quantities can be modeled using stochastic\nordinary differential equations.

The unique equilibrium price is characterized by a weakly\ncoupled system of linear parabolic equations which shows that holding and\nliquidity costs play dual roles.

It\nfills an important gap in the literature, by studying this market using two\nalternative multi-scaling methodologies. We find compelling evidence that\ncryptocurrencies have different degree of long range dependence, and --more\nimportantly -- follow different stochastic processes. Some of them follow\nmodels closer to monofractal fractional Gaussian noises, while others exhibit\ncomplex multifractal dynamics. Regarding the source of multifractality, our\nresults are mixed. Time series shuffling produces a reduction in the level of\nmultifractality, but not enough to offset it. We find an association of\nkurtosis with multifractality.\n",

        "summary": "  Testing large covariance matrices is of fundamental importance in statistical\nanalysis with high-dimensional data. In the past decade, three types of test\nstatistics have been studied in the literature: quadratic form statistics,\nmaximum form statistics, and their weighted combination. It is known that\nquadratic form statistics would suffer from low power against sparse\nalternatives and maximum form statistics would suffer from low power against\ndense alternatives. The weighted combination methods were introduced to enhance\nthe power of quadratic form statistics or maximum form statistics when the\nweights are appropriately chosen. In this paper, we provide a new perspective\nto exploit the full potential of quadratic form statistics and maximum form\nstatistics for testing high-dimensional covariance matrices. We propose a\nscale-invariant power enhancement test based on Fisher's method to combine the\np-values of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics. After\ncarefully studying the asymptotic joint distribution of quadratic form\nstatistics and maximum form statistics, we prove that the proposed combination\nmethod retains the correct asymptotic size and boosts the power against more\ngeneral alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate the finite-sample performance in\nsimulation studies and a real application.\n",

In a recent paper, Perez and Tun presented an ap- proximate\ncombinatoric and an exact recursive formula for the statistical weight of\nGentile Statistics, beginning from bosonic and fermionic cases, respectively\n[1]. In this paper, we obtain two exact, one combinatoric and one recursive,\nformulae for the statistical weight of Gentile Statistics, by an another\napproach. The combinatoric formula is valid only for special cases, whereas\nrecursive formula is valid for all possible cases. Moreover, for a given\nq-maximum number of particles that can occupy a level for Gentile\nstatistics-the recursive formula we have derived gives the result much faster\nthan the recursive formula presented in [1], when one uses a computer program.\nMoreover we obtained the statistical weight for the distribution proposed by\nDai and Xie in Ref.

Anyon statistics researches those systems in the winding\nnumber representation. Both of them are intermediate statistics between\nBose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. The second quantization of Gentile\nstatistics shows a lot of advantages. According to the symmetry requirement of\nthe wave function, we give the general construction of transformation between\nanyon and Gentile statistics. In other words, we introduce the second\nquantization form of anyons in a easy way. Basic relations of second\nquantization operators, the coherent state and Berry phase are also discussed.\n",

The classical Wilks' Lambda statistics are robustified by replacing\nthe classical estimates by highly robust and efficient reweighted MCD\nestimates. Further, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the\nperformance of the new test statistics under various designs by investigating\ntheir finite sample accuracy, power, and robustness against outliers.

We formulate a theory of generalized Fock spaces, which has a three\ntired structure consisting of Fock space, statistics and algebra. This general\nformalism unifies various forms of statistics and algebras, which were earlier\nconsidered to describe different systems. Besides, the formalism allows us to\nconstruct many new kinds of quantum statistics and the associated algebras of\ncreation and destruction operators.

        "summary": "  Approximations to the modified signed likelihood ratio statistic are\nasymptotically standard normal with error of order $n^{-1}$, where $n$ is the\nsample size. Proofs of this fact generally require that the sufficient\nstatistic of the model be written as $(\\hat{\\theta},a)$, where $\\hat{\\theta}$\nis the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter $\\theta$ of the model and\n$a$ is an ancillary statistic. This condition is very difficult or impossible\nto verify for many models. However, calculation of the statistics themselves\ndoes not require this condition. The goal of this paper is to provide\nconditions under which these statistics are asymptotically normally distributed\nto order $n^{-1}$ without making any assumption about the sufficient statistic\nof the model.\n",

        "title": "Fuzzy Statistical Limits",
        "summary": "  Statistical limits are defined relaxing conditions on conventional\nconvergence. The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is\nthat the majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going\non with other elements. At the same time, it is known that sequences that come\nfrom real life sources, such as measurement and computation, do not allow, in a\ngeneral case, to test whether they converge or statistically converge in the\nstrict mathematical sense. To overcome these limitations, fuzzy convergence was\nintroduced earlier in the context of neoclassical analysis and fuzzy\nstatistical convergence is introduced and studied in this paper. We find\nrelations between fuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and fuzzy\nstatistical convergence of its subsequences (Theorem 2.1), as well as between\nfuzzy statistical convergence of a sequence and conventional convergence of its\nsubsequences (Theorem 2.2). It is demonstrated what operations with fuzzy\nstatistical limits are induced by operations on sequences (Theorem 2.3) and how\nfuzzy statistical limits of different sequences influence one another (Theorem\n2.4). In Section 3, relations between fuzzy statistical convergence and fuzzy\nconvergence of statistical characteristics, such as the mean (average) and\nstandard deviation, are studied (Theorems 3.1 and 3.2).\n",

        "summary": "  Generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test statistics are often used in the\ndetection of spatial clustering in case-control and case-population datasets to\ncheck for a significantly large proportion of cases within some scanning\nwindow. The traditional spatial scan test statistic takes the supremum GLR\nvalue over all windows, whereas the average likelihood ratio (ALR) test\nstatistic that we consider here takes an average of the GLR values. Numerical\nexperiments in the literature and in this paper show that the ALR test\nstatistic has more power compared to the spatial scan statistic. We develop in\nthis paper accurate tail probability approximations of the ALR test statistic\nthat allow us to by-pass computer intensive Monte Carlo procedures to estimate\n$p$-values. In models that adjust for covariates, these Monte Carlo evaluations\nrequire an initial fitting of parameters that can result in very biased\n$p$-value estimates.\n",

        "title": "Multi-Statistic Approximate Bayesian Computation with Multi-Armed\n  Bandits",
        "summary": "  Approximate Bayesian computation is an established and popular method for\nlikelihood-free inference with applications in many disciplines. The\neffectiveness of the method depends critically on the availability of well\nperforming summary statistics. Summary statistic selection relies heavily on\ndomain knowledge and carefully engineered features, and can be a laborious time\nconsuming process. Since the method is sensitive to data dimensionality, the\nprocess of selecting summary statistics must balance the need to include\ninformative statistics and the dimensionality of the feature vector. This paper\nproposes to treat the problem of dynamically selecting an appropriate summary\nstatistic from a given pool of candidate summary statistics as a multi-armed\nbandit problem. This allows approximate Bayesian computation rejection sampling\nto dynamically focus on a distribution over well performing summary statistics\nas opposed to a fixed set of statistics. The proposed method is unique in that\nit does not require any pre-processing and is scalable to a large number of\ncandidate statistics. This enables efficient use of a large library of possible\ntime series summary statistics without prior feature engineering. The proposed\napproach is compared to state-of-the-art methods for summary statistics\nselection using a challenging test problem from the systems biology literature.\n",
